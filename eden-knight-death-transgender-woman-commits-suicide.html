She hoped for trans rights worldwide and bid farewell.</p><p>Her partner, known on Twitter as Parker, mourned her loss and promised to carry her memory with him for the rest of his life.</p><p>She stated, <strong>“I wanted to be a leader for people like me, but that wasn’t written to happen. I hope that the world gets better for us. I hope our people get old. I hope we get to see our kids grow up to fight for us. I hope for trans rights worldwide.”</strong></p><p>Knight’s family members confirmed her death on a Twitter account, which has since been made private.</p><p>The LGBTQ+ <a href=#>community</a> was deeply saddened by the suicide of transgender woman Eden Knight, and many <a href=#>social media</a> users called for justice using the hashtag <strong>#JusticeForEden.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It also illustrates the importance of protecting the rights and freedoms of marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, and providing support and resources for those who are struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>The loss of Eden Knight is a tragedy that must not be forgotten, and her memory should serve as a reminder of the ongoing fight for equality and justice.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxw56lZqOenrSpwIydnJqsmGLBs63NrJ6eppSav27DzqaYp2WTpLqutdOsZKytmZi2pbGO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./facebook-dating-launched-usa.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Facebook Dating Launched in U.S.A and 20 Other Countries">&larr;
