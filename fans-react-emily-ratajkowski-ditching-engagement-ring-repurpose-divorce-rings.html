"I've been wearing my divorce ring for years! Marriage wasn't forever, but the diamonds sure are," one Instagram user commented. "So good, let's quit this 'throw your ring into a water' thing," another shared. Other comments from fans referred to the rings as "stunning," "wow," and the "coolest idea ever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Ratajkowski has been divorced for almost two years now after marrying Bear-McClard in a court ceremony in 2018</strong>. <a href=#>She has been open about her split and the reasons for it</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There was also speculation that her husband cheated on her</a>, with sources telling Page Six, "Yeah, he cheated. He's a serial cheater. It's gross. He's a dog."</p><p>"I didn't have the courage to leave for a long time," she said in an interview on the Going Mental podcast in 2023. "I was 100 pounds, and I'd just had a baby, and like, I got really skinny because I was not OK. I tried everything else. I tried to take antidepressants. I was sure that something was wrong with me." In the same interview, she also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed how she was happy to be divorced</a>, saying it was "so nice to come back to myself, and return back to how I see the world, how I understand things, my instincts, whatever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-emily-ratajkowski-said-about-her-divorce>What Has Emily Ratajkowski Said About Her Divorce?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/emily-ratajkowski-and-ex-husband.jpg><p>When <a href=#>Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner's divorce</a> was announced, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ratajkowski commented on the trend of women getting divorced</a> at a young age. "So, it seems that a lot of young ladies are getting divorced before they turn 30," Ratajkowski said in a September 2023 TikTok video. "As someone who got married at 26 [who] has been separated for a little over a year [at] 32, I have to tell you, I don't think there's anything better.
