"No pictures of Karen and Kris together in the last 30 years or so says everything about their relationship," another wrote. Others have commented on how little had been said about Houghton, despite Jenner living much of her life in the public eye. "I don't recall Kris EVER even mentioning she had a sister," a comment reads. Another fan agreed, writing, "Not once has anyone mentioned her in all the years of filming and not one photo from the last what 20 years?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Why don't we ever hear about her sister????" one fan asked. While others responded with similar thoughts, some people were quick to shut down this line of questioning. "Maybe â€¦ just maybe ... it's none of our business," one response reads. Maybe she wanted to lead a private life. Sending thoughts and prayers for you because you were left in the dark." It is true that Houghton preferred to live her life away from the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiq6GjYremus2eqWarmajBpr7SZpuemaSdeqSt1KycZp6Zo66tuNhmqZ6ulZa5prCMsJyeo6NirqfAxKtkqZmjqLavs44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./marietta-deprima-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marietta DePrima Net Worth">&larr;
