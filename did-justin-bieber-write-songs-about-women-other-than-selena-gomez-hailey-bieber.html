And most of his <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> is about love, heartbreak, and confusing emotions. Since Bieber dated <strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez</a></strong> for years and is now married to Hailey Bieber, it's easy to guess that most of his songs are about these two relationships. However, the singer has dated a few other people. And given his huge music catalog, it seems likely that he penned at least a few tunes about some other women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who else has Justin Bieber written songs about? And what should fans know about these other relationships? While he has talked the most about Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber, Justin Bieber's other romances are just as juicy. And they might have influenced some of Bieber's most beloved songs.</p><h2 id=did-justin-bieber-write-a-song-about-caitlin-beadles>Did Justin Bieber Write A Song About Caitlin Beadles?</h2><p><a href=#>Usher and Justin Bieber kept in touch</a> after Usher helped the singer get his start in the music business. And while he was being mentored by Usher in Atlanta, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bieber began dating Caitlin Beadles</a>. Considering the massive success that Bieber has enjoyed for several decades now, it's easy to forget that he was once a young star just starting out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/justin-bieber-performing-onstage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>E! News reported that Justin Bieber might have written his song "Never Let You Go" about Beadles.</p><p>The song didn't hit number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was number 21, but that's still pretty good considering how many pop songs are released all the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/caitlin-beadles.jpg><p>According to E! News, Bieber and Beadles were in a relationship from 2008 to 2019. The publication reported that they split up as Bieber was becoming more well-known and that took its toll. Of course, they were both young at the time. It would have been tough to keep dating even if Bieber wasn't becoming a huge pop star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Justin Bieber Songs Are About Selena Gomez And Wife Hailey Bieber?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Never Let You Go" is definitely a romantic song. It was released in 2010 and features lyrics like "And when you hold my hand/Then I understand that it's meant to be/'Cause baby, when you're with me/It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven."</p><p>While those lyrics are absolutely cheesy, they were reminiscent of Justin Bieber's brand at the time. He sang pop songs that made his fanbase swoon. And now that he has gotten older, he still sings romantic songs. But, of course, his more recent music is about his wife Hailey Bieber.</p><p>Today, Caitlin Beadles has over 300,000 followers on Instagram and started a business called Caitlin’s Vine Of Bravery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/caitlin-beadles-beach.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, People reported that Beadles and Christian, her brother, went to Hailey and Justin Bieber's wedding in South Carolina. It seems that there were no hard feelings after their break-up because they stayed in contact with each other. This was the second wedding for the Biebers as they had previously tied the knot in 2018.</p><h2 id=did-justin-bieber-write-a-song-about-sofia-richie>Did Justin Bieber Write A Song About Sofia Richie?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber and Sofia Richie dated</a> for a period of six weeks, according to People. A source explained to E! News, "They were never officially together, but more casual hanging out and having fun." The source continued, "Justin doesn't want a relationship right now, he wanted to cool things down."</p><p>While Justin Bieber and Sofia Richie's time together was highly publicized, it doesn't appear that he wrote a song about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sofia-richie-is-praised-for-her-recent-rebrand-but-what-does-she-really-do_.jpg><p>Since they were only a couple for a brief period of time, Bieber might not have wanted to write about Richie. It seems that he has been the most influenced by his long-term relationships. And since he definitely seems like a romantic, that seems logical.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Justin Bieber's Father Have Anything To Do With Hailey? The Truth About Jeremy's Mysterious Relationship With His Daughter-In-Law</a></span></p><p>The singer doesn't appear to have said much about his relationships with Sofia Richie or Caitlin Beadles. However, he often talks about writing songs based on his love for Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/justin-bieber-walking-in-tribeca.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, he said of Gomez, “It was a long relationship that created heartbreak and created happiness, and a lot of different emotions that I wanted to write about," according to People. And in 2022, he said about being married to Hailey Bieber, "being inspired by my relationship has definitely produced some great music," according to Yahoo! Fans would absolutely agree with that statement because Bieber keeps releasing fun songs. His last two albums, "Changes" and "Justice," are just as good as his previous ones.</p><h2 id=did-justin-bieber-write-any-songs-about-his-ex-girlfriend-jasmine-villegas>Did Justin Bieber Write Any Songs About His Ex-Girlfriend Jasmine Villegas?</h2><p>While Justin Bieber has been linked to a few women, his other confirmed romance was with Jasmine Villegas.</p><p>Villegas starred in Bieber's "Baby" music video. They were a couple for less than a year. But while she was a huge part of this famous video, there is no evidence that the singer wrote any songs about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In August 2020, Villegas was interviewed by Celeb Secrets and talked about dating Justin Bieber. At the time of the interview, she was 26 years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Justin Bieber Really Date Kendall Jenner?</a></span></p><p>Villegas said, “After filming, we hung out a few times and we did date for a little bit. We were so young so I don’t even know if it counts as a relationship, but we did date for seven months which was really cool."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jasmine-villegas.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Villegas continued to Celeb Secrets that it was challenging to be asked to keep the romance a secret. She said, “Our close friends knew for sure, but he was in his prime and his core fans were girls so we couldn’t go out in public. We couldn’t have a boyfriend/girlfriend type of [relationship] and personally for me I felt like he was the star and I was the opener. We dated for the first half of the second leg and then actually broke up while on tour."</p><p>While Justin Bieber stayed pals with Caitlin Beades, he and Jasmine Villegas might not have stayed in touch. Villegas is a singer who put out two EPS, "That's Me Right There" and "No Judgement" in 2014 and 2019. She now has two children, a daughter named Mizo and a son named Zayne, according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdn8K0wMinZJuhlZeys3nWq6CtnV2ovK%2Bz0maYm6elqXq4u8yepWanpJ2ys3nToZinZaOauaa6wGaeqKWVr3qprcilnLJlkp6yo7HRaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gary-gulman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-143469-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Gulman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
