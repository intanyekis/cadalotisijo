Bocelli is about to return to the Golden State Warriors’ home to kick off his latest US tour.</p><p>The singer’s most recent album, “A Family Christmas,” was released in October and features collaborations with his son Matteo, 25, and his 10-year-old daughter Virginia. They are both on the current tour with him.</p><p>Bocelli responded to questions from The Chronicle via email.

Andrea Bocelli has a distinguished place in the musical world as one of the most famous opera singers today. He is regarded as having one of the most beautiful voices in the world, and he has released a number of successful albums. Bocelli has demonstrated his versatility over the years, collaborating with artists from a variety of genres, including mainstream pop music.</p><h2>Early Years and Childhood</h2><p>Andrea Bocelli was born in Lajatico, Italy on September 22, 1958. Following tests, doctors advised his mother to abort him as a baby because there was a good chance he would be born with a disability. Bocelli was born with congenital glaucoma, a condition that would severely impair his vision, because his mother ignored the advice.</p><p>Andrea Bocelli had a fascination with music by the age of six, as it was one of the few things that brought him joy. Bocelli began playing the piano at a young age and went on to learn the flute, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, guitar, and drums. Despite becoming a skilled musician on a variety of instruments, his own voice proved to be the most fulfilling musical outlet for him. Bocelli grew up listening to famous opera singers and dreamed of becoming a professional tenor later in life.</p><p>Although Bocelli could see to some extent before the age of 12, he became completely blind before the age of ten due to an accident during a soccer game. He was playing goalkeeper when the ball struck his eye, causing a hemorrhage. Bocelli became even more obsessed with singing than before.</p><p>He eventually graduated from secondary school and went on to law school at the University of Pisa, where he graduated with honors. Bocelli performed in piano bars at night while still a student. On one of these nights, he met Enrica Cenzatti, his future wife. He eventually graduated from law school and worked for a year as a court-appointed lawyer.</p><h2>Andrea Bocelli’s Career</h2><p>Andrea Bocelli rose to prominence in 1992, when he recorded “Misere” with rock star Zucchero and famous tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Bocelli was only supposed to sing on the demo track, which was then sent to Pavarotti for consideration.</p><p>However, after hearing Bocelli sing, Pavarotti insisted that this upstart new tenor take center stage. Eventually, an agreement was reached in which Pavarotti and Bocelli would perform together. When “Misere” was released, it became an instant hit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Andrea-Bocelli-1.webp><p>Bocelli then went on tour with Zucchero, singing duets and solos on various songs. He was almost certainly signed by a major label after that. From 1993 to 1994, Bocelli competed in numerous music and song contests throughout Italy, winning several. His debut album, released in 1994, went platinum in a matter of weeks. That same year, he toured again and made his opera debut as “Macduff” in Verdi’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s famous Scottish play.</p><p>Bocelli worked with many other singers and released more albums between 1994 and 1997. Many of these songs did extremely well around the world, particularly “Time to Say Goodbye,” which went six times platinum. When PBS aired one of his concerts in Germany in 1997, he was also introduced to American audiences for the first time.</p><h2>More on his Career</h2><p>Bocelli expanded his opera career with a leading role in La Boheme in 1998. Andrea Bocelli traveled to the United States to perform for the first time after releasing his fifth album. President Clinton personally greeted him after a performance in Washington, D.C. That marked the start of his first tour across North and South America, with stops in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Vancouver, and a number of other major cities. During this time, he also collaborated for the first time with Celine Dion on the single “The Prayer.”</p><p>During his tour, he also performed in operatic productions at the Detroit Opera House and many other venues around the world, including those in Hollywood. His seventh studio album, which was heavily influenced by religion, did extremely well on the US Classic Billboard chart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MERb69a4dba24f01bf0fd811c5bdeca0bocelli1207-1024x683-1.jpg><p>Bocelli continued to tour, release albums, and perform in various operas over the next few years.
