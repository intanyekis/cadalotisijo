The show followed the lives of Lauren Conrad, Heidi Montag, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrina Patridge </a>and Whitney Port as they navigate through the chaos of Los Angeles. The show later focused on more cast members, their relationships and the drama that unfolded between them, which involved boyfriends and love interests such as Spencer Pratt and Brody Jenner and a few friends along the way!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Much Do Reality Stars Make? The Average Pay Per Episode For The Top Shows Today</a></span></p><p>Although the show has since ended, MTV brought back a few of our favourite faces for a brand new series. "The Hills: New Beginnings", which stars a number of original castmates, aired earlier this year and became a hit amongst "The Hills" fans. While<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Lauren Conrad</a> and Kristin Cavallari didn't play a role in the new show, it appears as if there was enough drama to go around without them.</p><p>Considering the original show ended back in 2010 after 6 successful seasons, many fans are wondering what the cast has been up to and where has life taken then. From marriage, children to a number of successful best selling books, here is what the cast of "The Hills" has been up to!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-conrad><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Lauren Conrad</span></h2><p>Laure Conrad was the lead star of MTV's "The Hills". The show followed Lauren's life from Laguna Beach to Los Angeles and she instantly became one of the biggest reality television stars at the time. While <a href=#>Conrad </a>didn't last the entirety of the series, since she left after season five, she has since gone on to do a number of incredible things.</p><p>Not only has she scored herself the title of being a New York Time's best selling author, but she has also since gotten married to hubby, William Tell, who she shares two adorable kids with!</p><h2 id=whitney-port><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Whitney Port</span></h2><p>Much like Lauren Conrad, Whitney Port also left the series prior to it ending. Whitney left "The Hills" after season 4, but that wasn't it for her when it came to reality TV. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Port was commissioned her very own spin-off series, "The City",</a> which took place in New York City and followed Whit's journey to becoming a fashion designer.</p><p>Not only has she since created her very own fashion label, Whitney Eve, but Port has gone on to marry her hubby, Tim Rosenman back in 2015. The two now share a baby boy, Sonny and document their lives on Whitney's <a href=#>YouTube </a>channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=heidi-montag><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Heidi Montag</span></h2><p>Heidi <a href=#>Montag </a>and hubby Spencer Pratt ultimately disappeared from the last season of "The Hills" leaving many fans of the show concerned for their well being, since the two did not appear to be in great places at the time. Luckily, Heidi has not only made a return to MTV's newest gig, "The Hills: New Beginnings", but she has since become a mother to an adorable boy, Gunner, along with Spencer Pratt.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Lauren Conrad Been Up To Since "The Hills"?</a></span></p><p>Additionally, Heidi has also revealed her regret for undergoing a series of cosmetic procedures back in late 2009. She has since had many of her surgeries reversed, as she was beginning to experience a lot of pain from the 10 procedures she had done in one single day.</p><h2 id=audrina-patridge><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Audrina Patridge</span></h2><p>Audrina <a href=#>Patridge</a>, much like a few other "The Hills" alumni, managed to get her own spin-off, titled "Audrina" in 2011, however, that only lasted 1 season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star has since rejoined the cast for "The Hills: New Beginnings", and she certainly had a lot to share with fans. Patridge married her longtime boyfriend, Corey Bohan in 2016, in which the two now share their adorable baby girl, Kirra Max. In 2018, Audrina and Corey filed for divorce, which led her to a lot of confusion when she and former boyfriend, Justin Bobby, both signed up for the new show.</p><h2 id=kristin-cavallari><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kristin Cavallari</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>6 </span><span></span></h2><p>Kristin Cavallari may not have been part of "The Hills" for its entirety, but the star came in as of season 6 in order to replace Lauren Conrad. Kristin was essentially cast as the "bad guy", however, the star revealed that she was "acting" and the show itself towards its end was entirely scripted. Since then, Cavallari has moved to Nashville in order to be with hubby and NFL star, Jay Cutler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two married back in 2013 and share three kids together, Camden, Jaxon and Saylor. Despite the two appearing to be happy and having a hit E! show themselves, their marriage took a tumble earlier this year and the duo announced they would be splitting up for good.</p><h2 id=spencer-pratt><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Spencer Pratt</span></h2><p>As mentioned, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag's time on "The Hills" was cut short due to a number of concerning reasons surrounding the couple's mental health. The last we saw of Spencer was when he was having a mental breakdown in a Los Angeles club.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney Port: Reality Star To Women's Empowerment Hero</a></span></p><p>Since then, the star has focused on fatherhood and even graduated for USC in Political Science in 2014. Pratt is still very much into crystals, as depicted in the last season of "The Hills" and also rejoined the cast for their newest show. While things appear to be much better for Pratt, he is still considered the "villain" of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brody-jenner><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Brody Jenner</span></h2><p>Brody Jenner, who played the seasoned heartthrob throughout seasons 2 to 6 found himself romantically involved with the shows two stars, Lauren Conrad and then Kristin Cavallari.</p><p>Despite having since moved on from the show, Brody made a comeback with "The Hills: New Beginnings", however, he didn't do it alone. Jenner, who married Kaitlynn Carter in 2018, made his return alongside his spouse, however, things unravelled throughout the season and ultimately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">led the two to divorce only a year after tying the knot.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=justin-bobby><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Justin Bobby</span></h2><p>Justin Bobby was the true "bad boy" of "The Hills". While a few cast members couldn't stand him, he certainly had a hold on Audrina Patridge. While he remained a mystery throughout his time on the show, Justin Bobby was actually a celeb hairstylist before, during and after the filming of the hit MTV show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Cavallari Hooked Up With Cameraman On "The Hills"</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since its ending, Justin Bobby moved to Nicaragua for nearly 3 years and returned to Los Angeles in order to continue his work as a hairstylist. Justin managed to score a gig working for Maroon 5 and styling their hair throughout their tour.</p><h2 id=stephanie-pratt><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Stephanie Pratt</span></h2><p>Stephanie Pratt, who also joined the show later on, managed to make a mark in reality television after "The Hills" ended, but not in the United States. Pratt moved to the United Kingdom after the MTV show ended in order to play a role on the hit reality show "Made In Chelsea".</p><p>The star, unfortunately, has yet to find love, despite trying her hardest overseas, but that didn't stop her from rejoining the cast. Pratt now stars on MTV's "The Hills: New Beginnings" alongside Spencer and Heidi, whom she has been able to become close to again.</p><h2 id=lo-bosworth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lo Bosworth</span></h2><p>Lo Bosworth may have been a part of the series for a short amount of time as Lauren Conrad's BFF, but she certainly left a lasting impression. While she is no longer part of the show, at all, she has found her path as a culinary chef!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star attended the International Culinary Centre in New York City in 2013 and has since gone on to document her life on her YouTube lifestyle channel. When we had last seen Lo, she was in a committed relationship with longtime boyfriend, Scott Hoschstadt, however, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two have since split up for good</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of The Ladies From "The Hills" Looking Hot</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dnbatuNJmmpqrpGLEqbHRnmSaqpViwamx2GalqK9f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./malinda-x-d-nice-we-wanted-one-last-50916.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="We Wanted This One To Last">&larr;
