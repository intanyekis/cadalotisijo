That is a combined net worth with his wife since 2000, fellow country music singer Amy Grant. Vince Gill began studying and playing multiple instruments at the encouragement of his mother and father. He played in various bluegrass groups throughout his high school years and after graduating began to perform more high profile gigs. In the late 70s, he began performing with Pure Prairie League, a group that he had once opened for while in high school. He sang lead on their hit song “Let Me Love You Tonight”. In the 80s, he began to perform as a solo artist, and has gone on to record twenty successful studio albums. During his career, Vince Gill has sold more than 26 million albums worldwide. He has won 21 Grammy Awards and 18 Country Music Association Awards during his career. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2007.</p><h2 id=early-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vince Gill was born on April 12, 1957 in Norman, Oklahoma. His father, J. Stanley Gill, worked as a lawyer and administrative law judge. He also played in a country music band part-time and encouraged Gill to begin playing music. As a child, Gill began learning how to play the guitar and banjo, and then later learned the bass, mandolin, Dobro, and fiddle. Gill grew up with his older half-brother, Bob Coen. He attended Northwest Classen High School in Oklahoma City. There, he played on the golf team and also performed in the bluegrass band Mountain Smoke, which had a strong local following. In 1975, after he finished high school, he moved to Louisville, Kentucky to join the band Bluegrass Alliance. He also was briefly a member of Ricky Skaggs’s Boone Creek band before later moving to Los Angeles to join the bluegrass group Sundance, fronted by fiddler Byron Berline.</p><h2 id=career><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vince Gill debuted on the national scene with the country rock band Pure Prairie League in 1979. He appeared on the band’s album “Can’t Hold Back” and is the lead singer on the song “Let Me Love You Tonight.” He left the group in 1981 to join Cherry Bombs, the stage band that backed Rodney Crowell. While there, he worked with Tony Brown and Emory Gordy Jr., both of whom would later produce many of his albums. He also recorded a bluegrass album, “Here Today,” with David Grisman and friends before soon afterward signing a solo deal with RCA.</p><p>His early albums on RCA only achieved moderate sales. He left the label in 1989 to sign with MCA Records. His debut album on the label, “When I Call Your Name,” sold over a million copies. Several of the tracks on the album made the U.S. Country top ten charts. He followed up the album with his second release, “Pocket Full of Gold,” in 1991 and then “I Still Believe in You.” The title track on the latter album reached the number one spot on the U.S. Country charts.</p><p>Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Gill continued releasing very successful albums. He became well-known for his virtuosic skills on the electric and acoustic guitars as well as his pure and soulful tenor voice. He also was a highly skilled songwriter. He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1991 and celebrated his 25th Opry anniversary with a tribute show in August of 2016.</p><p>In addition to his solo career, Gill has continued collaborating with other artists. In 2010, he officially joined the country swing group, The Time Jumpers. He also appeared on a bluegrass tribute album for the British rock band, The Moody Blues. He worked with Bonnie Tyler on her 2012 album. Following the death of Glenn Frey of the Eagles, Gill joined the band. He serves as co-lead guitarist and also provides rhythm guitar and sings both back-up and lead vocals depending on the song. He initially started touring with the band in 2017 before becoming an official member.</p><p>Over the course of his career, over 40 of Gill’s singles have made the U.S. “Billboard” charts. He has sold more than 26 million albums. He has also been the recipient of 18 CMA Awards by the Country Music Association, including two Entertainer of the Year Awards and five Male Vocalist Awards. He also was the recipient of the Country Music Award’s Irving Waugh Award of Excellence in 2014. He was only the sixth recipient since the award’s inception in 1983. He has also received 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other male country artist in history. In 2007, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Gill received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September of 2012. In 2016, he was inducted into the Guitar Center Rock Walk by Joe Walsh of the Eagles.</p><h2 id=personal-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span><strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gill met country singer Janis Oliver of the Sweethearts of the Rodeo in Los Angeles when the two were both starting out in music. They married in 1980 and had a daughter named Jenny in 1982. In 1983, the couple moved to Nashville before divorcing in 1997. Gill first met Christian music artist Amy Grant in 1993 when he asked her to perform on his first televised Christmas special. Following both of their divorces, the two began to see each other publicly in 1999 and were married in March of 2000. They subsequently had a daughter together named Corrina.</p><p>Outside of his passion for music, Gill is also a scratch golfer and has organized and participated in many charity events centered around golf. He was inducted into the Tennessee Golf Hall of Fame in 2005. He was also honored with the 2022 Old Tom Morris Award by the Golf Superintendents Association of America to recognize his lifelong commitment to the game of golf. He is also a member of the board of directors of the Nashville Predators Foundation charity organization. Gill resides in Nashville, Tennessee and has a home studio there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fq7avr8RmnqKknKh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqnrcKtZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-javonte-brown-from-am-aggies-10-quick-facts-to-know-about-the-am-aggies-forward-487312-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Javonte Brown From A&amp;amp;M Aggies? 10 Quick Facts To Know About The A&amp;amp;M Aggies Forward ">&larr;
