On the show, the actor memorably played Angel, <a href=#>a vampire who struck an unlikely friendship (and romance) with Gellar’s Buffy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Boreanaz didn’t really have much acting experience then (<a href=#>before that, he only booked a handful of small roles, including one in the hit comedy series Married with Children</a>), his performance on the show was enough to convince creator Joss Whedon to give the actor his own spin-off. That’s essentially how Boreanaz ended up headlining his very own series, Angel.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Of The Very Best Episodes Of Angel</a></span></p><p>Angel stayed on the air for five seasons, picking up an Emmy nomination throughout its run. The show also established Boreanaz as a true Hollywood star too. Since then, the Buffalo native has landed several other lead roles as he continues to be one of the most recognizable faces on television today.</p><h2 id=after-lsquo-angel-rsquo-david-boreanaz-landed-a-lead-role-in-this-unusual-crime-procedural>After ‘Angel,’ David Boreanaz Landed A Lead Role In This Unusual Crime Procedural</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boreanaz may have <a href=#>enjoyed his time on Angel</a> but once the show was canceled, the actor knew it was time to move on from playing a vampire. This time, the actor stepped into the world of crime procedurals, landing the part of FBI agent Seeley Booth in the Fox show Bones.</p><p>As it turns out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox had been eyeing the actor </a>for one of the lead roles from the very beginning. "We cast David first. I didn’t even need a meeting when [former chairman and CEO of Fox Television Group] Dana Walden said, ‘Would you consider David Boreanaz?’” show creator Hart Hanson recalled. “I was going, ‘Yes, I’ll take him.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are David Boreanaz And Sarah Michelle Gellar Still Friends?</a></span></p><p>On the show, Boreanaz was paired with then-newcomer Emily Deschanel who played the show’s titular character, Dr. Temperance “Bones” Brennan. Throughout the show’s run, fans watched them investigate and solve cases together. Later on, the two characters also fell in love and started a family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Bones became highly successful, so much so that it went on for 12 seasons (although it is believed that the show could have stayed on for several seasons more if Fox hadn’t axed it).</p><p>At some point, Boreanaz also became more than just the show’s star. In fact, he, along with Deschanel, were eventually credited as producers as well. In addition, Boreanaz also went on to direct some of the show’s episodes, including its finale, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">features some of the most important people in his life</a>.</p><p>“My dad, my mom, my son, my daughter and [wife] Jaime, so the whole family is in it. Dad [a real-life newsman] does a news reporting kind of thing that’s a part of the storyline, which is great,” the actor revealed. “I was able to get them all in the series finale.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=today-david-boreanaz-stars-in-the-hit-action-drama-lsquo-seal-team-rsquo>Today, David Boreanaz Stars In The Hit Action Drama ‘SEAL Team’</h2><p>Following the end of Bones, Boreanaz quickly made his way from Fox to CBS to star in the hit series SEAL Team. Unlike Bones, the actor doesn’t solve murder cases every week here. Instead, he plays Jason Hayes, the leader of a Navy SEAL team that is tasked to carry out some of the most dangerous covert missions around the world.</p><p>For Boreanaz, it was a role unlike any other he’s done throughout his television career. And as fans may have guessed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it proved to be quite a physical challenge for the actor</a> too.</p><p>“The character himself has got a really aggressive drive,” the actor explained. "To even go into wanting to become a Tier 1 operator, they have to go through some serious physical endurance of strength training just to get through Buds, go through another 12 months of hell to even make it on a team. It's really about the drive for me and the character."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is David Boreanaz's Wife Jamie Bergman, And What Does She Do?</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, aside from being the show’s main star, Boreanaz also serves as an executive producer on the show today. And just like on Bones, the actor has also taken the opportunity to direct some of SEAL Team’s episodes over the years. This includes the show’s penultimate episode for its fifth season which sees Boreanaz’s Jason and his fellow SEALs shut down a Venezuelan nuclear facility during an undercover mission.</p><p>SEAL Team has already been renewed for a sixth season and Boreanaz has been hard at work filming the hit series, along with the rest of the cast. That said, there’s no word yet on when it will be released on Paramount+.</p><p>As for other projects, it’s possible that Boreanaz is up for anything, except a Buffy reboot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“No never, that’s not happening,” the actor once declared. "I have no problem with the cult audience at all, and I would totally get back into that genre because I love that, but I’m not a big reunion guy and not one to do those types of things. There’s no real reason for me to get involved in that right now.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Everything We Know About David Boreanaz's Time In The Military</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGiwsidZJunopqur63ZZp%2Baq12Xsqa6jK6nZqyfYsCqusKeZJutlpvGbq3NnWSappeauXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./scarlett-estevez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Is The Net Worth Of Scarlett Estevez? age, height, parents, Lucifer">&larr;
