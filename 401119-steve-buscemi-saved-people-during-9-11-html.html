Throughout the years, his wife supported him and baked goods for his former co-workers. Her untimely death ended a 32-year love story, and he appears to have changed a lot since her death.</p><p class=dh>Steve Buscemi is an American actor recognized mostly for portraying diverse roles as the bad guy, gangster, and mysterious man in Hollywood classics. Some of his earliest works include playing Willy in his debut film "The Way It Is," then Nick in the 1986 "Parting Glances," and an appearance as Rickles in an episode of "Miami Vice."</p><p class=dh>His breakthrough came in the 90s when he appeared as Mink in the neo-noir gangster film "Millers Crossing," the first of five of the Coen Brothers' films. The same year, he appeared as Test Tube, a henchman in the crime thriller "King of New York," and as Edward in the anthology film "Tales from the Darkside: The Movie."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dd1e7376e3564269a185aa884f187a5ea19b986b43e795dd382dc817f9641119.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>US actor Steve Buscemi arrives for the premiere of "If These Walls Could Sing," at the Metrograph in New York City on December 7, 2022. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In 1991, he appeared in yet another cult classic as the bellboy Chet in the black comedy "Barton Fink." Since making his film debut, the "Lean on Pete" actor had never landed a leading role until the 1992 "In The Soup," where he played Adolpho Rollo.</p><p class=dh>His role as pseudonymous criminal Mr. Pink in "Reservoir Dogs," however, gained him worldwide recognition and won him the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.</p><p class=dh>He has also done numerous voice-over works in animated films, including playing Templeton the Rat in "Charlotte's Web," Nebbercracker in "Monster House," Mr. Wesley in "Home on the Range," and Randall Boggs in "Monsters, Inc." among many others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f8e015aece04ae7de59423337ec1f58a7f168d7512da73f3a1ea848e496a4b66.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Steve Buscemi attends "The Year Between" premiere during the 2022 Tribeca Festival at Village East Cinema on June 12, 2022 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>While he is hugely recognized as a Hollywood star for his numerous films, the actor has also wowed fans with his involvement in an entirely different role. The actor proved his empathy when he put down his acting hat and joined his former colleagues in a heroic act that shocked the world.</p><p class=dh>When the twin towers at the World Trade Centers came crashing down in rubble after a terrorist attack in 2001, the Brooklyn-born actor was on the frontline in rescuing the survivors of the act.</p><p class=dh>The actor, who took his Fire Department of New York civil service test at 18, used his background as a firefighter to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.businessinsider.com/on-911-people-remember-how-steve-buscemi-searched-for-survivors-2017-9>rescue those trapped</a> in the rubble alongside other firefighters at his old station in Downtown Manhattan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/6e3de9f88900ef89958a74bfd93d65a643debdb283a3efd8e3ed52c6e6cd73c0.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Steve Buscemi attends Annual Charity Day hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald, BGC and GFI at Cantor Fitzgerald on September 11, 2017 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The actor became a fireman at Engine Company 55 — one of the busiest Engine Companies in Manhattan's Little Italy —<strong class=bh> </strong>in 1980 and worked as a New York City firefighter for four years. He then left the service to pursue acting.</p><p class=dh>Despite his colleagues talking him against leaving a steady job with a paycheck to pursue an uncertain venture, Buscemi was convinced that was the path he wanted to take, and he was not wrong. It paid off when he became a successful actor, writer, and producer.</p><p class=dh>After 16 years away, he was back at his old station. In the wake of the tragedy, the actor put in 12-hour shifts pulling out victims from the pile. Retired NYFD battalion chief Richard Ardisson showed his admiration for the actor, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/9-11-steve-buscemi-helped-survivors/>noting</a>:</p><p class=dh>“He put in 60 hours on top of the pile, pulling out victims. Not delivering coffee or giving moral support. He was exhausted and covered in soot."</p><p class=dh>"The Week Of" actor revealed that when the tragedy happened, he returned to Manhattan on the 12th and got into his old gear — turnout coat, helmet, and boots — and for the next five days, he volunteered at Ground Zero, digging through the rubble and pulling out victims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/68ad3268a2e4d11e28129dd7856316006e2e90af50c83c795e2812cc08849c31.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Steve Buscemi as a firefighter in the 80s | Source: YouTube/TIME</p><p class=dh>He described the scene as disconcerting and confusing, but he pushed on despite many of his fellow firefighters being buried alive in the burning wreckage.</p><p class=dh>His and his fellow firefighter's efforts bore fruit as they <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.firerescue1.com/fdny/articles/steve-buscemi-fdnys-most-famous-former-firefighter-HzCW4YbN2d58aBdN/>rescued many survivors</a> from the pile in the disaster that took the lives of 2996 people, including 2,977 victims and 19 hijackers who committed murder – suicide.</p><p class=dh>It was an act done from the heart, and Buscemi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/jlNf-7wZlS8>wanted no recognition</a> for it. In the following years, no one knew of his heroic act, and he refused to take any interviews questioning his involvement.</p><p class=dh>However, in 2013 the world learned of the actor's empathetic nature when the Brotherhood of Fire Organization posted a throwback photo of the actor on their Facebook page, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/9-11-steve-buscemi-helped-survivors/>asking</a> if anyone recognized him or knew his name:</p><p class=dh>"Lots of people know he's an actor and that his name is Steve Buscemi. What very few people realize is that he was once one of New York's Bravest."</p><p class=dh>Buscemi considers his act a privilege, adding that connecting with his former colleagues was a pleasure. And while he helped a great deal to rescue the survivors, he insists that being there was a massive help to him too. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/steve-buscemis-passion-project/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I went there to help, but I was the one who was helped, you know?

He strives to raise awareness and funding and even lets people know that the Friends of Firefighters is there for them.</p><p class=dh>He has since produced a documentary exploring the unique demands of working as a firefighter in New York City. He even followed up on the story of a former firefighter Larry Sullivan who developed cancer in the aftermath of 9/11.
