From talk show hosts to singers to actors, this cast brings a ton of talent and versatility to the table. While they bring this infamous musical to life, they certainly have careers outside of this popular flick.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Highest Grossing Films of 2019</a></span></p><p>In case you're wondering which furry creature has the most money to show for it, we've made a list. Here is the net worth of the cast of this new musical movie, ranked (according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=ray-winstone---5-million>Ray Winstone - $5 Million</h2><p>This famous actor plays Growltiger in this musical, but he has MANY acting credits under his belt. We're actually surprised his net worth isn't higher, but he's mostly famous from having a ton of secondary roles.</p><p>He has over 100 acting credits to show for his career, but we think you should check out&nbsp;The Departed, King of Thieves,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Point Break.&nbsp;Of course, he has many other to choose from, and that few million dollars are definitely from all of these famous flicks. He takes the first slot on this list with a net worth of $5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-corden---10-million>James Corden - $10 Million</h2><p>James Corden is an absolutely wholesome man, and we loved him as the furry Bustopher Jones. He has been in a few other flicks (like&nbsp;Ocean's 8), but we all know that he's most famous from being a late night talk show host. We love Carpool Karaoke and all of the wonderful celebrities he chats with on his show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of Taylor Swift's Top-Grossing Songs</a></span></p><p>James is hilarious, and that $10 million is definitely from making us all laugh while we tune into his talk show. We're definitely protecting this man at all costs.</p><h2 id=jason-derulo---10-million>Jason Derulo - $10 Million</h2><p>Jason Derulo is magnificent as Rum Tum Tigger, and it's no secret that this heartthrob is on all of our radars. Of course, Jason isn't known for being an actor. He's dominated the pop music scene, and he's sold over 30 million singles. He even has 11 Platinum singles, so it's safe to say he's doing pretty well in the industry.</p><p>Obviously, that's where most of his dough comes from, and we're sure he'll be making some more if he released some new music. Until then, you can listen to "Whatcha Say" over and over again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rebel-wilson---16-million>Rebel Wilson - $16 Million</h2><p>Rebel Wilson definitely stole our hearts in&nbsp;Pitch Perfect&nbsp;as Fat Amy, and she's only continued to dominate the comedy scene in Hollywood. She's most famously been in&nbsp;Isn't it Romantic, Bridesmaids,&nbsp;and&nbsp;How to Be Single.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, most of her dough comes from being apart of these hilarious blockbuster films. She's wonderful as Jennyanydots in this furry musical, and we're excited to see more from this hilarious and talented lady.</p><h2 id=jennifer-hudson---20-million>Jennifer Hudson - $20 Million</h2><p>While Jennifer Hudson played Grizabella in this musical, we know that she's most famous from her stellar singing career. Jennifer's voice always blows us away, and she's iconic as a musician. This Grammy winner has quite an impressive resume, and certainly some stellar songs that have smashed the charts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Idris Elba Roles, Ranked</a></span></p><p>If you love her as an actress, though, you can certainly find her on&nbsp;Dream Girls, Sex and the City,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Color Purple.&nbsp;This woman is a gal of many talents, and we're sure her net worth is far from its peak.</p><h2 id=idris-elba---25-million>Idris Elba - $25 Million</h2><p>Idris Elba is one of our all time favorite heartthrobs, and it's no secret that he's most famous for being an incredible actor. He plays Macavity in&nbsp;Cats,&nbsp;and slays it, as if we didn't think he had enough talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With $25 million to show for it, Idris has 1 Golden Globe under his belt, and has many blockbuster acting credits. You can catch him in&nbsp;Beasts of No Nation, The Mountain Between Us, Molly's Game, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and a handful of Marvel flicks where he plays Heimdall. We want to protect this man at all costs, and we can't wait to see what he'll be apart of next!</p><h2 id=judi-dench---35-million>Judi Dench - $35 Million</h2><p>Judi Dench is a legendary actress, and this woman has many acting credits that have contributed to her $35 million net worth. You might know her best as M in the 007 flick,&nbsp;Skyfall.&nbsp;However, she's been acting since the '60s, so it's safe to say she's quite the experienced icon. She plays Old Deuteronomy in&nbsp;Cats,&nbsp;but we know she has A LOT of incredible flicks to choose from.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of Ford V Ferrari's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Check out&nbsp;Victoria & Abdul&nbsp;and the latest cinematic adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;for some of her newest flicks. Of course, we're actually surprised her net worth isn't higher, but she does have four movies that are currently in post-production. So, sit tight for more of her brilliance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ian-mckellen---55-million>Ian McKellen - $55 Million</h2><p>Ian McKellen absolutely blew us away as Gus the Theatre Cat, and we shouldn't be surprised that this man has a whole ton of talents to share. Of course, most of his net worth comes from some impressive blockbusters, such as The Lord of the Rings franchise (where he plays the iconic Gandalf) or the X-Men franchise (where he plays Magneto).</p><p>With two Oscar nominations under his belt, he has over 100 acting credits to prove how wonderful he really is. We love this legend, and he certainly deserves the silver medal on this list with a $55 million net worth.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift---400-million>Taylor Swift - $400 Million</h2><p>It's probably not at all surprising that Taylor Swift absolutely blows this list out of the water. This queen is certainly successful, and while she plays Bombalurina in this furry musical, we know that she's absolutely infamous as a pop singer. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> has had a stellar career, and she was recently even named the Artist of the Decade at the AMA's in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We could make a whole list of her achievements, so we'll just venture to say that she has 10 Grammys, 29 AMAs, and has sold over 50 million albums. This woman is a legend, and we're not even mad that her net worth is as stellar as it is. If anyone deserves it, it's probably this bombshell.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Of The Highest-Grossing Movie Soundtracks Ever</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8Kaq6xlk5bAtXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5yKeapa2UnruoedOasKWnomLAuLXFrWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./we-rocking-with-mark-tiktok-trend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="We Rocking With Mark TikTok Trend - Song and Lyrics Original">&larr;
