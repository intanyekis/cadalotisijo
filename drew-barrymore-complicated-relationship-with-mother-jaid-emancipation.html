In the Vulture article, it was revealed that Barrymore financially supports her mother. "But I have to f****** grow in spite of her being on this planet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barrymore's parents are the actor Jaid and John Drew Barrymore. The 50 First Dates star famously became emancipated from her parents during her troubled youth. She had drug-fueled outings to nightclubs with mother, a compulsory stint in rehab at age 13 and a number of suicide attempts.</p><p>In recent years, the actress appears to be more accepting of her mother after years of ups and downs, although it hasn't been easier.</p><p>Vulture also reported that, weeks after the interview took place, the actress sent the outlet a text about messages that she shared with her mother. “I don’t care how old you get or how big your mission is. When your mom tells you she loves you, you revert back to small,” <strong><a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a></strong> wrote in her text. “And the fact that she loves me with my truth, and my honesty, is the best time I have ever heard her say it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drew-barrymore-wants-her-mother-to-be-happy>Drew Barrymore Wants Her Mother To Be Happy</h2><p>Despite their complicated relationship, Drew Barrymore wishes the best for her mother."I actually want her to be happy and thrive and be healthy," the Charlie's Angels actress explained.</p><p>“I dared to say it, and I didn’t feel good,” she told the outlet. “I do care. I’ll never not care. I don’t know if I’ve ever known how to fully guard, close off, not feel, build the wall up.” Her mother was born in a displaced people’s camp in Germany to Hungarian second world war refugees, and was still a wild child when she had Drew in 1975.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Does Drew Barrymore Feel About Fans Calling Her A 'Cringey' Talk Show Host?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barrymore recently hit back at tabloids for misconstruing her words and claiming she wanted her mother dead</a>. "I have been vulnerable and tried to figure out a very difficult, painful relationship while admitting it is difficult to do while a parent is alive," Barrymore explained in an Instagram post.</p><p>She added: "Do not twist my words around or ever say that I wished my mother was dead. I have never said that. I never would. In fact, I go on to say that I wish that I never have to live an existence where I would wish that on someone.
