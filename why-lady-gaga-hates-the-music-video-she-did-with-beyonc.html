During the nearly 15 years that she has been in the spotlight, she has constantly experimented with new sounds and styles, unleashing her creativity in her costumes, stage performances, and in her famous music videos. Most of the time, those risks paid off and contributed to Gaga growing as an artist. <a href=#>Her 2011 album ‘Born This Way’ changed the lives of millions of fans</a>, and wouldn’t have done so if Gaga hadn’t authentically expressed herself as an artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the career moves that Gaga believes didn’t work so well, however, was the unforgettable music video she did with Beyoncé for her 2009 hit ‘Telephone’. Seemingly inspired by Thelma and Louise, as well as rumors regarding Gaga’s anatomy, the video made headlines, but Gaga isn’t a fan. Read on to find out why she hates it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Lady Gaga's Net Worth, And How Did She Earn It?</a></span></p><h2 id=lady-gaga-rsquo-s-career-in-2010>Lady Gaga’s Career In 2010</h2><p>When the ‘Telephone’ music video was released in early 2010, Lady Gaga was a certified superstar. After the release of her debut album ‘The Fame’ in 2008, followed by ‘The Fame Monster’ in 2009, Gaga had won over her own mammoth army of fans. She was making headlines for her catchy songs like ‘Poker Face’ and ‘Paparazzi’, <a href=#>her showstopping performances</a>, and her unique costumes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the ‘Telephone’ single came off Gaga’s 2009 album, fans had to wait until the following year for the video to be released. And when it was, it definitely broke the internet (by 2010 standards, anyway).</p><h2 id=the-music-video-for-lsquo-telephone-rsquo>The Music Video For ‘Telephone’</h2><p>The music video begins with Gaga being taken to prison. While she’s there, Beyoncé bails her out and the two head to a diner where they poison Beyoncé’s sleazy boyfriend and a bunch of other people. Then they flee the scene of the crime.</p><p>In true Gaga style, the video is complete with crazy costumes and head pieces, well-rehearsed choreography, and cryptic dialogue. While the video made headlines at the time, Gaga has since come out to say that she wasn’t a fan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Awful Way Haters Bullied Lady Gaga Before She Was Famous</a></span></p><h2 id=why-gaga-hates-it>Why Gaga Hates It</h2><p>In an interview with Time Out, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaga admitted that she “hates” the ‘Telephone’ video</a> “so much.” Why? The singer explained that there are too many ideas in the video and she wishes she “had edited myself a little bit more.”</p><p>Looking at the video objectively, there does seem to be a lot going on. The jail sequence takes several minutes and requires multiple costume changes, then there’s the driving scenes and the diner scenes too. All in all, the video nearly takes 10 minutes. But still, many of Gaga’s fans love the video, even if she doesn’t feel the same way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-view-on-beyonc-eacute-rsquo-s-part-in-the-video>Her View On Beyoncé’s Part In The Video</h2><p>While Gaga thinks there was too much going on in the video, she doesn’t have any issue with Beyoncé at all. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Ryan Seacrest</a>, she revealed that she and the ‘Formation’ singer respect each other and aren’t competitive at all.</p><p>“She’s so kind. We get along,” she said (via Entertainment Weekly). “She was very courageous in this video. I mean, can you imagine me saying, ‘Okay, now, Beyoncé, now you have to call me a very bad girl and feed me a honey bun’? … She trusted me because she likes my work, and she trusted me because she knew that I love her and that it’s a mutual respect.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lady Gaga Once Made An Appearence In This Hit TV Show</a></span></p><h2 id=how-she-feels-about-the-song>How She Feels About The Song</h2><p>Unfortunately, Gaga doesn’t just take issue with the music video for ‘Telephone’. She’s also not in love with the song itself. She admitted in a 2011 interview with Pop Justice that she actually hates the song and has a difficult time listening to it.</p><p>However, she did clarify that her feelings don’t come down to the song itself being bad: "Ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me," she explained. "So when I say it's my worst song it has nothing to do with the song, just my emotional connection to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-favorite-songs-that-she-rsquo-s-done>Her Favorite Songs That She’s Done</h2><p>Okay, so ‘Telephone’ isn’t on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaga’s list of favorite songs of hers</a>. Which songs are?</p><p>According to Capital FM, Gaga believes that ‘You and I’ off her ‘Born This Way’ album is one of the best songs she’s ever written. There’s also a special place in her heart for ‘Bad Romance’, along with ‘Poker Face’, ‘Marry the Night’, and ‘Americano’.</p><p>It’s been quite a few years since Gaga listed these tracks as her favorites, and she’s since released three more solo albums, two collaborative albums with Tony Bennett, and a soundtrack album with Bradley Cooper for the 2018 film ‘A Star Is Born’ which she starred in. So it’s very possible that Gaga has some new favorite Lady Gaga songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>According To Jay-Z, This Is What He And Beyonce Do In Their Spare Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoa6lxYygmKCZXZ2utbHSZquhnV2iwrS1wmatopyVpHq0tMRmm6KcXay2tbSMm5yyp56YfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./derek-jeter-children-how-many-kids-does-he-have-family-and-married-life-derek-jeter-children-how-many-kids-does-he-have-family-and-married-life.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Derek Jeter Children: How Many Kids Does He Have?
