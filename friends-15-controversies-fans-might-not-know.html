Indeed, the groundbreaking series changed the landscape of television forever. The series turned the cast members into overnight celebrities. They all remain stars in the industry, although their fame is now at various levels. The show developed one of the most loyal fan bases in the world. Critics praised Friends every week, and it went on to win several awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Friends hasn’t aged well over the years. Several jokes and storylines are not looked upon favorably. In the early 90s, many of those jokes and plot lines&nbsp;flew under&nbsp;the radar. Instead, fans and critics heaped praise on the show. At the same time, all wasn’t peachy behind the scenes. There were several behind the scenes controversies that the producers kept quiet.</p><p>In the last few years, Friends has come under fire for several controversies. Many of the cast members even came forward to speak about the issues. It’s time to take a closer look at one of the greatest shows in history.</p><h2 id=ross-and-the-male-nanny><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Ross And The Male Nanny</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ross-Geller-Friends.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends is a groundbreaking series</a> that tackled issues most shows didn't. However, the series often made offensive jokes aimed at the LGBTQ community. The show also featured storylines that mocked the community. For instance, Ross didn't like Rachel hiring a male nanny, Sandy.&nbsp;Ross felt Sandy&nbsp;was too sensitive - and not a man - for being a nanny.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-almost-didn-t-return-for-the-final-season><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston Almost Didn’t Return For The Final Season</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Rachel-Green-Friends.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Each cast member</a> became a massive star due to the success of Friends. However, Jennifer Aniston reached a level of celebrity that the other actors didn’t. Indeed, Aniston’s movie career was taking off towards the end of the series. Jennifer was so busy, she almost didn’t return for the final season. She was able to return after the producers cut the episodes from 24 to 18.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Said No To SNL Alongside Adam Sandler To Become Part Of Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=andre-agassi-was-extremely-jealous-when-brooke-shields-guest-starred><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Andre Agassi Was Extremely Jealous When Brooke Shields Guest-Starred</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Friends-Brooke-Shields-.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke Shields guest-starred on Friends</a>, in the episode, “The One After The Superbowl".&nbsp;She portrayed a crazy fan stalking Joey - she licks his fingers in one scene. However, the real drama was behind the scenes. Shields' then-husband, tennis player Andre Agassi, lost his mind when Shields&nbsp;had to lick Matt LeBlanc’s fingers. He destroyed his Wimbledon trophies during a heated argument with Shields.</p><h2 id=phoebe-and-chandler-weren-t-supposed-to-be-main-characters><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Phoebe And Chandler Weren’t Supposed To Be Main Characters</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Friends-Phoebe-And-Chanlder-.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s safe to say Friends wouldn’t be the same without Chandler and Phoebe. At first, the show was going to be about the other four characters, with Chandler and Phoebe taking on secondary roles. They were simply going to be the comic relief. Of course, that changed after the casting process. Chandler and Phoebe became two of the most popular characters.</p><h2 id=elliot-gould-upset-the-producers-when-he-spoiled-the-season-four-finale><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Elliot Gould&nbsp;Upset The Producers When He&nbsp;Spoiled The Season Four Finale</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Geller-Family.jpg><p>In the season four finale, Ross famously says Rachel’s name when marrying Emily. Indeed, the series is known for its twist endings. However, Elliot Gould spoiled the surprise. Gould portrayed Jack Geller in the show. During an interview before the finale aired, Gould revealed&nbsp;the twist ending. The producers were furious that he would make such a slip-up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cast-hated-the-joey-and-rachel-romance><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Cast Hated The Joey And Rachel Romance</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Joey-And-Rachel-Friends-1-1.png><p>Friends featured several popular romances. However, there was one&nbsp;love story&nbsp;that most people hated. At one point, Joey and Rachel develop feelings for each other. However, fans and the cast hated the storyline. Matt LeBlanc and Jennifer Aniston both fought the writers on the storyline and got it dropped.</p><h2 id=ross-tries-to-get-close-to-his-cousin-cassie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ross Tries To Get Close To His Cousin, Cassie</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ross-And-Cassie-Friends.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ross Geller made a lot of questionable decisions. Indeed, he did a few things that could land him in jail or worse. For instance, Ross once dated one of his students, which is wrong on so many levels. Of course, nothing tops the time he thought his cousin Cassie was hot and tried to get close to her. To be fair, Denise Richards portrayed Cassie.</p><h2 id=chandler-and-monica-bomb-on-a-play-storyline-cut-after-9-11><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Chandler And Monica Bomb On A Play Storyline Cut After 9/11</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chandler-And-Moinca-.jpg><p>In the season&nbsp;eight premiere, Chandler and Monica go on their honeymoon, but another newlywed couple&nbsp;upstages them at every point. Originally, the show wrote and shot a completely different storyline.</p><p>Initially, Chandler and Monica are detained at the airport after Chandler jokes about bombs on a plane. However, the 9/11 attacks occurred shortly after filming.

However, it’s not without controversy. Indeed, Ross’s perception of the couple was often murky. NBC anticipated a great deal of fan backlash when the couple married. They ended up getting only four pieces of hate mail. Of course, fans now notice that Susan and Carol don’t kiss at the end of the ceremony.</p><h2 id=monica-mocked-for-being-overweight-in-her-younger-days><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Monica Mocked For Being Overweight In Her Younger Days</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Monica-And-Chandler-Friends-.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the show’s running jokes throughout the entire series is Monica being overweight when she was younger. Indeed, Courteney Cox even throws on a fat suit to portray a younger Monica.&nbsp;Despite losing all the weight, her friends still mock her.

David Schwimmer came up with the idea to form an alliance and command the same amount. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The producers found it frustrating</a> at times and even called the demands “ridiculous”, according to Ranker.

However, Perry struggled with substance abuse. He had serious addiction issues behind the scenes. His physical appearance and weight fluctuated noticeably throughout the series. Perry also had a stint in rehab between seasons.

However, one issue that critics point out now is the lack of diversity in the cast. Indeed, the six best friends live in New York but rarely run into a person of color. Of course, Ross dates Julie, Kristen, and Charlie, although they’re the only characters of color and they play minor roles.</p><h2 id=chandler-s-father><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chandler’s Father</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chandler-And-His-Parents-.jpg><p>Chandler’s father, Charles Bing/Helena Handbasket, is transgender and was one of the first trans characters on a prominent show. The show gets praised and criticized for Chandler’s father. Chandler’s father was often the butt of the joke. Indeed, Chandler was ashamed of his father and didn’t want to invite Helena to his wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising BTS Facts About Chandler On Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=living-single-vs-friends><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Living Single vs. Friends</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Living-Single-Friends.jpg><p>The critically-acclaimed sitcom,&nbsp;Living Single, revolved around the lives of six young African-American best friends living in a Brooklyn brownstone. The series debuted thirteen months before Friends. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans often notice similarities between the two series</a>&nbsp;and many credit Living Single with creating the template that Friends used.</p><p>Some fans accuse the Friends creators of stealing the series concept from Living Single.
