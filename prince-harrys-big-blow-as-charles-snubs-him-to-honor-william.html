Instead of hanging out with his father, the Duke of Sussex enjoyed dinner with city financier <strong>Guy Monson</strong>.</p><p>Former BBC Royal correspondent Michael Cole said: “It is quite a snub. For the King to not see his younger son, Prince Harry, although the two men will be only two miles apart tomorrow afternoon, gives an indication of the depth of the divide.”</p><p>The Duke of Sussex touched down in London from California yesterday to celebrate the tenth anniversary of his Invictus Games.</p><p>His spokesperson told Us Weekly that it was “<a href=#>unfortunately not possible</a>” for Harry and the monarch to meet up “due to His Majesty’s full programme” as he returns to public duties during his treatment for cancer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>They said in full: “In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not The Duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty’s full programme,’ he said.</p><p>“The Duke of course is understanding of his father’s diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.”</p><p>Harry last saw his father in February following his diagnosis. The prince is also unlikely to be visiting William and his wife<strong> Princess Kate Middleton</strong>, who is undergoing treatment for cancer. He arrived solo in London and is expected to join his wife<strong> Duchess Meghan Markle</strong> on a tour to Nigeria soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7GjYq%2Bqs4ybo6ivXZbAbq%2FHmqmlnaNiwK%2FBwaxkoaGdYsGweceopaiqXay2rbjImqRo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ramon-rodriguez-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ramon Rodriguez Net Worth  How Much is Ramon Rodriguez Worth?">&larr;
