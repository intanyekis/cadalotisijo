The TV host does not like the idea of getting married; maybe that's why she did not tie the knot with her previous boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>Reid, who appears in the show alongside <strong>Piers Morgan</strong> in the show <i>Good Morning Britain</i> is quite outspoken when it comes to her relationship. In many of the interviews, the TV host has talked about her children and her partner.</p><h2>Susanna, "I'll never marry."</h2><p>On November 24, 2019, Reid and Morgan host the show alongside showbiz correspondent <strong>Gemma Collins</strong>. During the show, Piers asks Gemma about her on/off boyfriend <strong>James Argent</strong>. Collins replied by saying she is in the never marrying camp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/26/Piers-Susanna-Reid-GMB-t-1574764230241.jpg><p>After the statement by Gemma, Morgan turned to Reid and asked her if she is still in the never marrying camp. Reid <a href=#><strong>insisted on her decision to not walk down the aisle</strong></a><strong>, </strong>and this came after her break-up with her boyfriend, <strong>Steve Parish</strong>.</p><p>Even though Susanna vowed never to marry, her co-host Piers is a married man. He was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Marion Shalloe</strong></a>. Now, he is delighted with his current wife, <a href=#><strong>Celia Walden</strong></a>.</p><h2>Who was her Last Boyfriend?</h2><p>The <i>GMB</i> host fell in love with a businessman in early 2019. Steve is a multi-millionaire businessman who currently owns Premier League club <i>Crystal Palace</i>. Parish and Susanna went public with their romance in December 2018, after Piers forced her to address the affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/26/Susanna-Reid-Steve-Parish-football-z-1574764305630.jpg><p>Even though Morgan seems a bit mouthy at times, in this case, he played the role of a matchmaker for his co-host. Piers introduced Susanna and Steve, which kindled the romance between the couple. After dating each other for almost nine months, the duo called it quits.</p><p>When the media spotted her with Steve in January 2019, the pair looked very comfortable with each other. But replying to the question of marriage, she insisted that the relationship is going very well, and she is not thinking about tying the knot. In April 2019, the duo parted ways with each other.</p><h2>She was in a Long-term Relationship</h2><p>No, Reid was never married but was in a long-term relationship with <strong>Dominic Cotton</strong>. The duo met each other in the late 90s, and by 1999, they got into a committed relationship. According to the reports, the pair relationship reached a melting point after Dominic refused to appear on <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i> audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/26/Dominic%20Cotton%20and%20Reid%20(the%20sun)-1574764345271.JPG><p>Reid performed with professional dancer <strong>Kevin Clifton</strong> on the show. At the final, when the producers asked about Cotton, it was revealed he wasn't there. As per reports, Cotton quickly moved on from his fifteen years relationship and started looking for a girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo ended their romance in March 2014 but remained under the same roof. They are still terrific friends, and in an interview, Reid admitted that Cotton is a better parent to the boys as he's always there for them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/11/26/Daily%20mail-1574764720227.JPG><p>Reid gave birth to three sons, <strong>Jack Cotton, Sam Cotton</strong>, and<strong> Finn Cotton, </strong>who are now busy in their lives. Dominic has now moved on with his new girlfriend, <strong>Gayle Harrison.</strong></p><p><i><strong>For further updates, stay tuned to </strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqysrJmeo65uvsSim2alkafBqq3LZqqtmaWo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-hola-soy-dora-girl-on-tiktok-meaning-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Hola Soy Dora Girl On TikTok?
