Fans were first introduced to Hot Ones on YouTube back in 2015. The show's concept is what it's adored for: two people, the host Sean Evans and a celebrity, having a conversation and answering questions, all while trying to keep their minds, body, and stomachs intact as they eat some of the hottest chicken wings the universe has to offer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show has been running stronger than ever in its 19th season and has a roster of over 275 episodes all with the heat being kicked up a notch, every single time. The show started off with humble beginnings yet with some big names that made for classic episodes like DJ Khalid and Machine Gun Kelly. The show has also hosted some of the biggest names ever in music and in Hollywood like Post Malone, Natalie Portman, Gordon Ramsay and way more. Out of all the celebrities that fans loved seeing on the show, here are some of the ultimate fan favorite interviews on Hot Ones!</p><h2 id=dj-khaled-started-a-long-hot-ones-tradition><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>DJ Khaled Started A Long Hot Ones Tradition</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DJ Khaled was on of the very first celebrities to be featured on Hot Ones as he made it in the season premiere of the show. With DJ Khaled may have a "take no Ls" mentality, but he sure did on his very short-lived appearance on the show. Out of generally 10 standard rounds, DJ Khaled tapped out right after round two, not even making it to the interview's 5-minute mark. His underwhelming appearance made fans critique him on Reddit and <a href=#>some consider this another reason to his declining popularity</a>. After this episode, fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launched the Hot Ones hall of shame</a> and the off the bone rule that only real hardcore followers know about today.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Don’t Know How To Feel As A Shirtless DJ Khaled Dances To Drake’s ‘Way 2 Sexy’">Fans Don’t Know How To Feel As A Shirtless DJ Khaled Dances To Drake’s ‘Way 2 Sexy’</a></span></p><h2 id=joji-showed-fans-another-side-on-the-show><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Joji Showed Fans Another Side On The Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Joji had his time as a famous YouTuber in his own right</a>, so his time on Hot Ones probably felt as natural as ever. The singer does not usually do many interviews, so when fans got his solo one on one with Sean Evans, they were happy to get a glimpse of who he is as a person after breaking his YouTube character. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He has another Hot Ones interview with fellow label mate Rich Brian</a>, but fans can't wait to see him return to the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Joji Became The Musician He Is Now">How Joji Became The Musician He Is Now</a></span></p><h2 id=billie-eilish-was-everything-that-fans-wanted><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Billie Eilish Was Everything That Fans Wanted</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billie Eilish is a <a href=#>chart topping music phenomenon that took the world by storm</a> when she was just 17. The young pop star appeared on the show 3 years ago at the height of her new-found fame, and her vibes were the perfect match to the show's! The interview allowed fans an extensive look at who she is, how she functions and best of all, how much of a blast it is to be around her!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="9 Lesser-Known Facts About Billie Eilish And Jesse Rutherford's Relationship">9 Lesser-Known Facts About Billie Eilish And Jesse Rutherford's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=keegan-michael-key-and-jordan-peele-were-hilarious><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele Were Hilarious</span></h2><p>The hilarious duo are inseparable in fans' minds, and this interview solidified fans' wholesome love and connection they feel to legendary comedians Key and Peele. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their sketches are all over the internet with millions of views</a>, but since the duos creative split, their fan base keeps going back to the classics. That's why people who love the duo are always happy to see any Key and Peele content in general, especially something as organic and lighthearted as this interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=post-malone-was-such-a-sweetheart-twice><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Post Malone Was Such A Sweetheart, Twice</span></h2><p>The raper, singer-songwriter Post Malone did not make fans and viewers fall in love with him just once on Hot Ones, but he successfully managed to woo everyone twice. When fans watch the interview, it's easy to see why he is so well liked as a person, not just for his music.</p><h2 id=lizzo-got-her-hot-sauce-crown-on-hot-ones><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lizzo Got Her Hot Sauce Crown on Hot Ones</span></h2><p>Three time Grammy Award winner Lizzo absolutely owned Hot Ones as she blazed through the hottest sauces in the world like a breeze. The artist rapped, talked about her studies and classical music training, and had a very fun and engaging conversation with host Sean Evans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-rudd-dabbed-on-hot-ones><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Paul Rudd Dabbed On Hot Ones</span></h2><p>The universally loved comedian and Marvel star Paul Rudd went on a viral episode of hot ones where he took on flamin' cauliflower instead of the signature hot wings. The actor's wholesome attitude and interaction with Sean Evans made this episode endearing to watch, and showed a deeper yet lighter side of Paul Rudd that fans always love to see.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-is-the-heat-that-hot-ones-fans-couldn-39-t-handle><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Gordon Ramsay Is The Heat That Hot Ones Fans Couldn't Handle</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of course, who can be a better judge of culinary spice than the man, the myth, the legend, chef Gordon Ramsay himself. He was fans' number one requested guest on the show, and his episode garnered an impressive 113 million views to date, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which inspired a fundraiser event</a> the year after the episode aired in celebration of the holiday spirit!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6pLvMqaOerJWhxm6%2FzJqqoZ2UYrWwwIyopZ6rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charina-almanzar-age-how-old-is-ice-spices-mother-wikipedia-and-age-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charina Almanzar Age: How Old Is Ice Spices Mother?
