Many people have heard of Mr Las Vegas, and if you’re paying attention, you’ve probably noticed his first wife.</h3><h3>Elaine, a former flight attendant, rose to prominence after marrying American singer and entertainer Wayne Newton. She is said to be an American of mixed race from Honolulu, Hawaii.</h3><h2>How much is the net worth of Elaine and Her Ex-Net Husband?</h2><p>Elaine Okamura is well-known as the wife of Wayne, an American singer. She does not, however, have a well-known name in her field. Furthermore, we have no idea what profession she chose. As a result, her net worth is unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pinteresttt-1-1670496817384.jpg><p>Her ex-husband, on the other hand, is Mr Las Vegas, aka <a href=#>Wayne Newton</a>, who had a successful career as one of the most famous singers of the mid-twentieth century. He is estimated to be worth more than <strong>$50 million.</strong> He is best known for his songs Daddy Don’t You Walk So Fast and Danke Schoen.</p><h4>ALSO READ: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Stine Schyberg – Alex Van Halen’s Wife</a></h4><h2>Early Life Facts</h2><p>Elaine Okamura, aka Elaine Newton, Wayne Newton’s wife, was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, according to sources. She is believed to have been born in 1944. However, the precise date remains hidden behind closed doors. And, based on her last name, she appears to be of Japanese descent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pinterestst-1-1670495154694.jpg><p>Aside from the fact that she was a stewardess for an American airline, not much is known about her. Because she rose to fame only after her marriage, little is known about her early life.</p><p>Elaine attended Kaimuki High School for her high school education, according to BiographyMask. The school is in her hometown of Honolulu, Honolulu County, Hawaii, USA.</p><h2 id=ex-wife-of-wayne-newton>Ex-Wife Of Wayne Newton</h2><p>Elaine Okamura and Wayne Newton, the former couple, married on June 1, 1968, in Las Vegas. Their wedding ceremony took place at the Little Church of the West.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dicy-Trends-1-1670495132384.jpg><p>On the occasion of their marriage, the former couple reportedly hosted a breakfast gathering at the Flamingo with approximately 75 guests. According to sources, they chose that particular hotel because Wayne’s brother used to perform there. Furthermore, he had been performing in the same hotel for the previous 11 years.</p><p>However, after nearly seventeen years of marriage, the lovely couple who shared the vows of eternal love divorced. When their first child was nine years old, they divorced in 1985.</p><h2 id=how-did-they-meet?-they-got-engaged-on-christmas-day>How Did They Meet? They Got Engaged On Christmas Day</h2><p>Elaine was still a flight attendant at the time of their first meeting. Though there is no information on how their love developed, they began dating after their first counter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/vizaca-1-1670495886155.jpg><p>The couple dated for about two years before marrying in 1968. Furthermore, after getting engaged on Christmas Day in 1967, the couple made it official.</p><h2 id=is-elaine-active-on-social-media?>Is Elaine Active On Social Media?</h2><p>Elaine is not on any social media platforms. Despite a thorough search, none of her accounts were discovered, implying that she does not use social media. However, her husband, Wayne, is active on Instagram and Twitter.</p><p>Despite being one of the greatest entertainers in the industry and becoming known as Mr Las Vegas due to his presence, Wayne is not very active on social media.</p><p>He has over 6k followers on Instagram and goes by the handle <a href=# rel=nofollow>@waynenewtonmrlv</a>. He has a little less than 8k followers on Twitter as <a href=# rel=nofollow>@WayneNewtonMrLV</a>.</p><h2>Elaine and Wayne Have Adopted A Child</h2><p>Many people have their own theories about the birth of Erin Newton, Wayne and Elaine’s first child. Some think she’s the couple’s biological child. It is true, however, that she was adopted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/closerweekly-1-1670496576186.jpg><p>Erin, their daughter, was born on July 25, 1976. We believe the adoption was closed because no details were available. And, according to sources, Erin moved in with her mother following her parents’ divorce.</p><h2>Physical Attributes: Height and Weight</h2><p>Elaine Okamura has all the characteristics of an Asian woman. Just by looking at her, you can tell she is of Asian descent. Her hair is black and her eyes are brown. Because she was born and raised in Hawaii, the public was taken aback by her distinct Asian features, which bore no resemblance to those of the Pacific islanders.</p><p>Her ex-husband, Wayne Newton, stands at 6 feet 1 inch tall. Despite his age of eighty, he is still a very healthy man who weighs around 175 pounds, according to sources.</p><h2 id=elaine-disappeared-after-her-divorce>Elaine Disappeared After Her Divorce</h2><p>Elaine Okamura, a former flight attendant, and her husband, Wayne Newton, divorced in 1985 after seventeen years of marriage. She vanished after her divorce. She seemed to have vanished without a trace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tukooss-1-1670495946632.jpg><p>Elaine is no longer in the public eye. Previously, she could be seen attending various events without her husband. However, after their divorce, she disappeared from events, public appearances, and the media.</p><p>Elaine did not update her location or well-being because she does not use social media.</p><h4>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Louise Watts Age, Net Worth & Biography</a></h4><h2 id=did-elaine-remarry?-and-what-about-wayne?>Did Elaine Remarry? And What About Wayne?</h2><p>Elaine does not appear to have remarried following her divorce from Wayne Newton. Though we can’t be sure because there hasn’t been any news about her, if Elaine had remarried, it would have shattered the internet.</p><p>However, we cannot be certain that Elaine did not remarry after her divorce. She may have pursued her love life in a secretive manner because she has always been a private person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/tukoos-1-1670495805361.jpg><p>Although there is no news about Elaine, the same cannot be said for the famous singer Wayne Newton. Following his divorce from Elaine, he married Kathleen McCrone, a former legal advisor from North Olmsted, Ohio, on April 9, 1994.</p><p>Not only that, but Wayne and his current wife, Kathleen, have a daughter, Lauren Ashley Newton. This romantic couple is currently living a happy life with their daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJ2clravsYyoopqlpaeucA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lance Kerwin Cause of Death: Former Child Star Dies at 62">&larr;
