And one such character was Chyler Leigh's Lexie Grey, though she met a sad end in the eighth season of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it was Chyler's choice to leave the series, and she's since made a brief return (in the 2021 episode 'Breathe'), too. Just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like Eric Dane upon his return</a>, it was like Chyler had never left.</p><p>Fans probably won't see her make another comeback on 'Grey's,' though, and not just because her character is, well, dead. In fact, Chyler left the series because of personal reasons, not because she was fired or had a disagreement with anyone on set.</p><p>She wanted to spend more time with her family, noted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Distractify</a>, which includes her husband Nathan West and their three children. In fact, she was only briefly in the earlier season 8 episodes because of an "extra hiatus" with her loved ones, says the publication.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things Chyler Leigh Has Done Since 'Grey's Anatomy'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So who is Chyler's husband, and what does he do? It turns out, West is just as creative as his wifey. In fact, the two even work together sometimes, and they met while&nbsp;working on '7th Heaven' in 2000. Of course, that&nbsp;was back when West was appearing in 'Bring It On,' too, though he didn't earn huge fame from it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like the actresses in the movie (and its sequels) did</a>.</p><p>They were married in 2002 and welcomed their children in 2003, 2006, and 2009. Those kids are Noah, Taelyn, and Anniston, respectively.</p><p>But their collabs go beyond kids! In 2009, West even made an appearance on 'Grey's.' But the pair didn't stick around TV together that much. That's because Nathan West is a musician. He's known as East of Eli and has been performing for decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chyler often joins her hubby on stage and in the studio, and the pair have released music together under the band name WestLeigh. Though Nathan's work often keeps him away from his wife (he was in the UK while she was working in the US), the two clearly reconnect through their tunes.</p><p>They've released songs together throughout their relationship, including a special track for their 13th anniversary -- "Love Lit the Sky." Nathan may not be quite as famous as his wife, but he does have an impressive 36K followers on Instagram, and he had a global tour in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to making music, West has also embarked on other projects. He produced a film in 2019 ('The Remarkable Life of John Weld'), plus an earlier one in 2012 ('Brake'). His acting resume may have been cut short after 2010, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, but that doesn't mean West isn't staying busy.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Do Fans Feel About DeLuca's Death On 'Grey's Anatomy'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieq52pqHqiusCtpqaxXay1sHnIrGScoKmhsrN5y56goKBdncK0rsCnm2amkam1orqMsJysrF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-verchere-gopaulsingh-age-wikipedia-girlfriend-parents-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Will Verchere-Gopaulsingh?
