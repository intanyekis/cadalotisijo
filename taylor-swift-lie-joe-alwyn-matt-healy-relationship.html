It became more sensational when Alwyn reacted to the news of her relationship with Healy, making many wonder if there was some sort of dynamic among the trio.</p><p>Towards the final months of Taylor Swift's relationship with Joe Alywn, <strong>she and Matt Healy worked together on her 2022 album, "Midnights."</strong> Naturally, the actor was aware of the pair's collaboration and was reportedly fine with it. However, <strong>Alwyn appeared to retrace his steps after Swift and Healy's dating news</strong>, causing the public to wonder if the <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> star lied to him about the nature of her friendship with Healy. This article will examine <strong>the relationship dynamics that Taylor Swift had with Alwyn and Healy</strong>, as well as a look back at when she met the pair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-39-s-relationship-with-matt-healy-cause-tension-with-joe-alwyn>Did Taylor Swift's Relationship With Matt Healy Cause Tension With Joe Alwyn?</h2><p>The most profound confirmation of Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's breakup was <strong>his absence when Swift kicked off her iconic Eras tour in March 2023</strong>. <a href=#>Despite writing over ten songs about the actor,</a> he was nowhere to be found during her most anticipated tour. The separation was as quiet as the ultra-private six-year run of their relationship. Despite the undramatic manner in which Swift and Alwyn broke up, the final moments of their relationship ended up being sensational as <a href=#>fans wondered what went wrong</a>. This was because <strong>Swift grew close to her former flame, Matt Healy,</strong> around that time. It is noteworthy that <strong>Swift started dating Healy a few weeks after breaking up with Alwyn</strong>.</p><p>The dynamic among the trio further piqued fans' curiosity due to <strong>Joe Alwyn's reaction to Taylor Swift and Matt Healy's dating news</strong>. According to the DailyMail, the "Stars at Noon" actor was quite upset that his ex-girlfriend moved on quickly. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He was reportedly also unhappy</a> because he put his trust in Swift when she collaborated with Healy.

Back in November 2022, the 1975 lead vocalist revealed that he and Swift worked together on her album, and he described her as "amazing." Two months later, in January 2023, the "Willow" crooner gave an impromptu performance at The 1975's concert at the O2 Arena in London. The insider who spoke to DailyMail stated that Alwyn was aware of the pair's collaboration. They noted:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Joe was aware that Taylor and Matt were making music together and collaborating.

The former couple broke up in April 2023, but leading up to that, Matt Healy seemed to be more present in her life. He promoted the Eras tour during the final leg of The 1975's tour. By May 2023, Swift was photographed kissing Healy during a dinner date in Manhattan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_joe-alwyn-changed-his-relationship-to-his-dating-life-after-breaking-up-with-taylor-swift_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Joe Alwyn Changed His Relationship To His Dating Life After Breaking Up With Taylor Swift">Joe Alwyn Changed His Relationship To His Dating Life After Breaking Up With Taylor Swift</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Why is Joe Alwyn so secretive when it comes to his love life after dating Taylor Swift?</p><p><strong>Joe Alwyn's career profile and Net worth according to celebrity net worth</strong>:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Joe Alwyn</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Birthdate</p></td><td><p>February 21, 1991</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>profession</p></td><td><p>Actor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Career</p></td><td><p>Active since 2015</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Net Worth</p></td><td><p>$4 million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong></strong></p><h2 id=when-did-taylor-swift-meet-joe-alywn-and-matt-healy>When Did Taylor Swift Meet Joe Alywn And Matt Healy?</h2><p>It appears the trio's fate was tied together in that the timeline of the first time they met is partly connected. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift first met Matt Healy in 2014</a> during his concert.

Two years later, in 2016, she became romantically linked with Joe Alwyn. This happened a few months after her breakup with Tom Hiddleston. However, according to Elle Magazine, it was not until 2017 before an insider confirmed that Swift and Alwyn were indeed an item.
