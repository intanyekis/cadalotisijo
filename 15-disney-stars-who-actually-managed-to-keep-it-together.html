Its&nbsp;headquarters is located at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It ranks second among media conglomerates in terms of revenue, just one rank shy of global telecommunications company, Comcast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disney established itself as a leader and branched out into live television, film production, and theme parks. It&nbsp;eventually weaved its&nbsp;way into American pop culture as many people follow Disney stars even after they have “graduated” from the channel. You can thank the Disney brothers–<a href=#>Walt</a> and Roy–for creating the conglomerate, which now has divisions and subsidiaries worldwide. The founding of Disney dates back to October 16, 1923, in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Over the years, we’ve watched so many Disney stars grow, but not all of them had the chance to live the happy lives that were portrayed in the shows and movies they used to star in. Many of them had to deal with the harsh realities of the adult world. As a result, their fame was tainted, and in some instances, they lost their own lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Disney family hasn’t always been functional. Just like every other family, some people dealt with illnesses, struggles, and tragedies. But, not all Disney stars have gone off the deep end. Some of them left the channel and continued their success in the entertainment industry. Fans may bring up toxic relationships and failed marriages, but their records are pretty clean. From <a href=#>Cole and Dylan Sprouse</a> to <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, you’re able to recognize some, if not all, of these former Disney stars.
