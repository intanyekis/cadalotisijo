But by all accounts, Queen Elizabeth II was a beloved monarch, leading Britain for over 70 years. Most of the recollections of her are of a strong, steadfast woman who was well-equipped to take over when her father passed away unexpectedly and she became queen at the age of 25. Though people may have disagreed with her, criticisms are piling up since her passing was announced.Of course, there have always been <a href=#>complaints about the way that the late Queen treated Princess Diana</a> years ago, but is there a reason why people are suddenly so angry about the British monarch's reign now?As it turns out, there might be something to the criticisms of the British monarchy, and it goes beyond just the Queen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=some-people-seem-to-be-celebrating-queen-elizabeth-s-death>Some People Seem To Be Celebrating Queen Elizabeth's Death</h2><p>Though much of the conversation began on Twitter, Reddit, and other social platforms, Newsweek summed it up well by saying that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen Elizabeth's "continued colonialism"</a> is the reason why so many people are... not unhappy that she's gone.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditors put it somewhat less eloquently</a>, quipping that "Fun fact: the most celebrated holiday in the world is independence from the British." Another posited, "Why do people still care when rich people die? They don't care when the poors die. I promise. She'd have stepped on your grandmother to avoid a puddle."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Noticed An Immediate Change To Social Media Following The Queen's Death">Fans Noticed An Immediate Change To Social Media Following The Queen's Death</a></span></p><p>The inevitability of death aside, some people aren't really about mourning Britain's late queen, or respecting the monarchy at all, as it seems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Memes about then-Prince Charles have been circulating for ages already, and pre-internet jokes preceded the digital form of jest. For example, some social media commenters joked about Charles' lack of work for the past 70-plus years, noting that <a href=#>his first speaking bit — a televised address</a> — must have been nerve-wracking.</p><p>The thing is, it doesn't seem personal necessarily, this sudden vitriol against the British monarchy. In fact, it seems that the Queen being in the news was enough to set many people off.</p><h2 id=why-are-people-angry-at-the-british-monarchy-right-now>Why Are People Angry At The British Monarchy Right Now?</h2><p>The answer to why people are angry about the Queen, King Charles III, and the monarchy in general is complicated. Colonialism is one, notes Newsweek, and as one author stated on Twitter, "it is entirely appropriate to examine the queen and her role in the devastating impact of continued colonialism."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=colonialism-is-a-problem-but-there-s-more-hate-against-the-queen>Colonialism Is A Problem, But There's More Hate Against The Queen</h2><p>That's not the whole of the drama, though. Redditors (and others) also criticized the late queen for "the pedo son she protected," referring to <a href=#>Prince Andrew and his many million-dollar court defense</a>.
