The two movie stars, hot off the backs of films such as Batman, Beetlejuice, and The Hunt For Red October, married in August 1993 and <a href=#>welcomed daughter Ireland two years later</a>. And while their careers thrived for the next several years (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two even played themselves in an episode of The Simpsons</a>) their marriage was not so fortunate.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Alec Baldwin Looks Broken While Laying Low With Family After 'Rust' Shooting</a></span>Basinger and Baldwin separated in 2000 and were divorced by 2002. The stars outlaid a reported $3 million in legal fees for the divorce proceedings alone. Baldwin's career was on the rise, with the New York native landing a lead role four years later on the <a href=#>satirical sitcom 30 Rock</a>. And despite huge success for Basinger in the late 1990's, her star has since waned, and she is perhaps best known now for her turn as Christian Grey's paramour in the <a href=#>50 Shades franchise</a>. But two decades after their separation, which actor has the higher net worth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-kim-basinger><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Kim Basinger?</span></h2><p>Born in 1953 in Athens, Georgia, Kim Basinger began her career as a model. She appeared as a magazine cover girl and was featured in several advertisements before breaking into the television industry in the late 1970's. She landed her first film role in 1981's Hard Country, and only two years later, the coveted role of a Bond Girl alongside Sean Connery in 1983's Never Say Never Again.</p><h2 id=struck-by-the-oscars-curse><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Struck By The Oscars Curse</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Basinger worked consistently throughout the next decade, with notable roles in Batman, Blind Date, and Nine 1/2 Weeks. Her career peaked in 1997 with L.A. Confidential, for which she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress the following year, only to find herself struck with the supposed "<a href=#>Oscars Curse</a>" and her <a href=#>career subsequently went on the decline</a>.</p><h2 id=where-it-went-wrong><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Where It Went Wrong</span></h2><p>It was reported that Basinger lost huge portions of her income in the early 1990's after an investment went wrong. Basinger had <a href=#>invested in the purchase of the Georgian town Braselton</a> in 1989 with plans to develop the town with infrastructure enough to host a yearly film festival. But the plans never came to fruition and she had to sell her shares of the investment as she was <a href=#>being sued by Main Line Pictures for $8.1 million</a> for breaking her contract. The huge payout as stipulated by the case led Basinger to file for bankruptcy in 1993. She was also instructed to pay out $9,000 a month for eight years beginning in 1989 to her ex-husband Ron Snyder-Britton. She was later duped by Bernie Madoff, the celebrity Ponzi scheme fraudster who conned investors out of over $64 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kevin Federline's Estimated Net Worth Is $6 Million: How Britney's Ex Made His Money</a></span></p><h2 id=her-net-worth-today><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her Net Worth Today</span></h2><p>Despite the multiple financial setbacks Basinger has faced in her life, according to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her net worth sits at $20 million</a>. She has earned her fortune from an acting career spanning five decades, as well as profit made on real estate and product endorsements.</p><h2 id=alec-baldwin-s-family-history-in-america><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Alec Baldwin's Family History In America</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alec Baldwin hails from one of the oldest European families in the United States. The actor's family can be traced directly to passengers on the Mayflower, and his family's fortunes are an example of the American Dream, with Baldwin and <a href=#>his three younger brothers</a> all going on to become successful actors.</p><h2 id=he-earns-a-steady-income><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Earns A Steady Income</span></h2><p>Like his ex-wife, Baldwin also has an acting career spanning five decades. But unlike Basinger, whose fame began to fade post-90's Oscar glory, Baldwin's only grew. Nominated for an Oscar himself for 2003's The Cooler, Baldwin would land the role of Jack Donaghy in NBC's 30 Rock, the satirical sitcom set at the company's iconic Manhattan address. The role would give him a consistent income of $300,000 per episode until the series ended in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Jacob Elordi's Ex Helped Him Make His Impressive Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=baldwin-enjoys-giving-back><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Baldwin Enjoys Giving Back</span></h2><p>Baldwin is known for his charity work and philanthropy. Baldwin and his family created the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carol M. Baldwin Cancer Research Fund</a> in honor of his mother who underwent a double mastectomy while being treated for breast cancer. As a spokesperson for Capitol One, Baldwin had his contract rewritten so that the entirety of his $14 million contract was donated directly to the charity. He is also known for donating significant sums of money to various symphany orchastras, literacy programs and theatres.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-massive-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Massive Net Worth</span></h2><p>Celebrity Net Worth puts <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baldwin's accumulated wealth at $60 million</a>, three times as much as his ex-wife. They credit this to his contributions to the entertainment industry, being the recipient of numerous entertainment awards nominations and wins, and his overall large and varied career in the arts. Baldwin has also taken on extra roles behind the scenes of his productions, including producing, as he did on the long running sitcom 30 Rock, as well as the <a href=#>plagued prodution Rust</a> that saw the accidental death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins at the hands of Baldwin.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Twitter Slams Donald Trump Jr. For Selling Gross 'Alec Baldwin Kills People' T-Shirt</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiioqVdl660tc2gnKtlmJ60qbHRZqWerF2svLPAx2acsWWYqsCjrc2dZJqklZh6o63Lna6ipl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heather-graham-young-through-the-years-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heather Graham Through The Years: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr;
