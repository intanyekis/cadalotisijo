Likewise, Angela, who works as a paralegal, was excited to settle down with her new husband. However, the tragic death of her spouse swept her dreams right away.</p><p>Although the couple was dating for several years, they didn't share any children. Angela knew about Joel's health condition. The pair would travel to different exotic places for vacations. Besides, Joel used to take his therapy dog, Lola, because of his acute diabetes condition.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>There is no exact information about Joel Connable's net worth.
