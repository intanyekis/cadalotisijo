Most of the time they are to do with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity's secret boyfriend</a> or perhaps even a secret disorder or illness. But in the case of Richard Simmons, the famed and flamboyant, fitness instructor to the stars... the mystery is about his true whereabouts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's what we really know about it...</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Why Adele Disappears After Every Album ">The Real Reason Why Adele Disappears After Every Album</a></span></p><p><strong>Updated on March 16, 2022: </strong>Richard Simmons has remained withdrawn from the public eye, and that seems to be just how he likes it. While he no longer appears on television or at major public events, all reports and indications suggest that is he safe and healthy and simply living his life in peace. However, for fans of the beloved fitness icon who miss him and his work, Simmons still regularly posts old workout videos on his YouTube channel for all to enjoy.</p><p>In March 2021, it was announced that his fitness show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweatin' to the Oldies will begin streaming on a new service</a>, and Simmons released a public statement, saying, "I am very excited that my groundbreaking fitness series of Sweatin' to the Oldies still is so relevant and popular and I hope many new fans will discover these timeless classics."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=some-people-are-very-worried-about-richard-simmons>Some People Are Very Worried About Richard Simmons</h2><p>Richard Simmons has not made a major appearance in public since 2014. By 2016, many people began to get <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worried about his whereabouts</a>.</p><p>Before we get into Richard's whereabouts as well as the controversies that surrounded his supposed disappearance, it's important to note that people care about this issue because they care about Richard. The man was a mainstay on television for decades. His TV fitness infomercials both inspired and entertained. He appeared on numerous talk shows, scripted series, and even Whose Line Is It Anyway?, always making audiences laugh with his over-the-top flamboyant nature and charisma.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Without a doubt, Richard is the man who made fitness fun. His desire to get people moving launched a business empire that people still adore and subscribe to.</p><p>But Richard himself is nowhere to be seen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Beloved â€™90s Stars Who Vanished Into Thin Air</a></span></p><p>Many in the media have asked about Richard Simmons's location. But perhaps no one more so than radio legend Howard Stern. After all, Richard was a frequent guest on his show and audio clips from various interviews are stil aired on The Howard Stern Show for gags. Howard has also claimed that he almost had a friendship with Richard. In short, there's an affinity there. So, the discussion of Richard's true whereabouts has come up a lot. But Howard Stern is far from the only person wondering what happened to Richard. This is because Richard's disappearance feels just like... a legitimate disappearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When celebrities leave the mainstream, they tend to still be around. But Richard basically hasn't been seen for years.</p><p>So, naturally, people are very worried.</p><p>Pair this with some pretty outrageous rumors, and you've got a full-on potential controversy on your hands...</p><h2 id=the-rumors-and-the-truths-about-richard-simmons-39-disappearance>The Rumors And The Truths About Richard Simmons' Disappearance</h2><p>In March 2016, many in the media started to share a story about how Richard was being held hostage by his housekeeper, which is why he hadn't been seen publicly since 2014. In order to dispel this rumor, Richard phoned into The Today Show and claimed that these accusations were totally false.</p><p>But the fact that Richard decided to phone in, versus make a physical appearance, made people even more worried. Just a few months later, Richard shut down his fitness studio without making an announcement to his fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pair the rumors about the housekeeper and these strange moves, and you've got the reason why a podcast called "Missing Richard Simmons" started. After all, so many people were confused by his sudden and complete disappearance given the fact that the man was once everywhere.</p><p>Rumors continued to swirl which caused the LAPD to go to Richard's home and check up on him. Afterward, the LAPD issued a statement claiming that Richard was "perfectly fine" and was "doing what he wants to do" at home. But not long after, Richard was forced to leave his home and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">check into the hospital for severe indigestion</a>, according to The Washington Post. This is what caused him to post a photo of himself on Facebook, claiming that all the speculations were false and that he was still around and not "missing".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after his stint in hospital, Richard vanished again. Although he did make some noise when he sued the National Enquirer, American Media, and Radar Online for suggesting that he was transitioning into a woman and that's why he was no longer in the public eye.</p><p>However, Richard ended up losing the libel lawsuit and had to pay the fees of the defendants' attorneys.</p><p>This lawsuit was followed by another in June 2018 when he sued an L.A. private investigator for apparently placing a tracking device in his car. According to Distractify, Richard claimed that In Touch Weekly had hired the investigator to track him down.</p><p>It seems everyone wants to know what the heck happened to Richard.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Stars Who Totally Vanished After One Major Movie Flop</a></span></p><p>And yet, he won't and still hasn't given his fans any answers, and that is why they continue to pursue him.</p><p>Even though Richard hasn't said anything publicly, his brother, Lenny, has, according to People.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After 40-some odd years, he just decided that he wants to rest," Lenny said to People Magazine. "Heâ€™s 68 years old now, and heâ€™s in good health, but he just wants time for himself."</p><p>So, at this point, it looks like we'll never get a direct answer from Richard and that means people are still going to wonder what on Earth happened to him...</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Fans Are Addicted To This Ryan Gosling And Harrison Ford Interview</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdp7aktMCrm2armaK6sLrSZq2appmotaawjJ%2BpqKVdnbytuNiwpqicXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-matt-cornett-girlfriend-brookelynn-elizabeth-dating-life-relationship-details-of-the-high-school-musical-actor-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Matt Cornett Girlfriend Brookelynn Elizabeth?
