"They'd been fighting a lot, and their schedules have been challenging for them. Gwen and Blake felt they had fallen out of love."

"They prioritized spending time with one another and got back to doing the things that brought them together in the first place, like making music," an insider told Life&Style. The source adds, "Gwen and Blake have had their ups and downs. While it hasn't always been a bed of roses, they like to think they made it to the other side."</p><p>The couple recently released their song, Purple Irises. It is an emotional track, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with lyrics including</a>: "But if someone comes along and tries to love you like I love you /Don't know what I'd do, don't wanna lose you /Everything fades /Everything dies /Put me in a vase, but you can't /You can't stop time." It continues, "It's not 1999 /But this face is still mine /The way you look at me /I swear my heart hits rewind."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-been-said-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-39-s-marriage>What Has Been Said About Gwen Stefani And Blake Shelton's Marriage?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton.jpg><p><strong>Since Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani first got together, they have had to deal with many rumors about their relationship. This includes reports that they were headed for divorce</strong>. Reading untrue reports about yourself in the media likely takes a mental toll, and Stefani has previously addressed her relationship publicly and put an end (at least temporarily) to the split rumors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had been going through those times where you're questioning: 'Oh my gosh, am I just getting older? Am I cute?'" Stefani told NYLON in April 2024. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In my own relationship</a>, even though I know the truth of what's happening today, you still create drama in your own mind about your insecurities and what might happen. I was in that phase of the relationship with Blake and getting paranoid." She continued, "The truth is I am in love with my best friend, and all this s*** I'm thinking of in my brain, that's all it is â€” I'm overthinking."</p><p>While it is clear that the singer feels very strongly about her husband, she admitted to noticing the divorce reports. "But when you're in love and have truly aligned values, nobody can get to us," she said. "You can say whatever you want to say about our relationship â€” I mean, a week ago, we were getting divorced again or something. It's just lies. The truth is the truth, and we know what that isâ€¦"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqK2imLJur8uaoKarXZzEprqMrKuenpGjtm6uy5qinmWjnbKtwM6nZJuZk6B6p77OpmSbqpmjuG6wyK%2Bmq5uVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tyler-hoechlin-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyler Hoechlin Net Worth  How Much is Hoechlin Worth?">&larr;
