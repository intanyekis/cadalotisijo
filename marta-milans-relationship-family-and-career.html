Marta, an actress from El Embarcadero, rose to fame with her charming performance in the television series No Tomorrow.</strong></p><p>In addition to her work, Milans’s romantic news frequently makes headlines. Milans’ romantic life became a topic of discussion following rumors that the actress was seeing her co-star Joshua Sasse. It seems that the rumors destroyed Sasse’s eighteen-month engagement to Kylie Minogue.</p><h2><span id=Marta_Milans8217s_romantic_life_Her_bond_with_the_ex-fiance_of_Kylie_Minogue_Joshua_Sasse>Marta Milans’s romantic life: Her bond with the ex-fiance of Kylie Minogue Joshua Sasse</span></h2><p>The media took a keen interest in Marta Milans’ purported romance with Joshua Sasse at the beginning of 2017. Even Kylie Minogue, Sasse’s former fiancée, called off their engagement as a result of their dating rumors.</p><p>On February 29, 2016, the ex-couple made their engagement public. But because of her alleged connection to Sasse, Marta became the focal point of their breakup when news of their separation broke in February 2017.</p><h2><span id=Marta_Milans_and_Joshua_Sasse_her_rumored_boyfriend_first_connected_on_a_set>Marta Milans and Joshua Sasse, her rumored boyfriend, first connected on a set</span></h2><p>The comedy-drama TV show No Tomorrow, which aired on The CW, is where the two initially crossed paths. Marta portrayed Sofia, an enthusiastic traveler and photographer, while Sasse played the quirky and free-spirited character of Xavier Holliday.</p><p>Marta and Joshua never discussed their alleged affair in public, despite the intense rumors. When asked about his sister’s increasing closeness to Joshua, Sander, Milans’ brother, remained silent regarding the likely nature of their connection. He declared,</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>He went on to say,</p><p>“I don’t know anything, therefore I don’t have anything to say. I doubt I would say anything even if I did.</p><p>He went on,</p><p>“I am aware of Kylie Minogue, but I’m not sure how my sister fits into this whole thing. It is something completely unfamiliar to me.</p><p>Even that Milans and Sasse are only close friends is implied by several tabloids.</p><h2><span id=Marta_Milans_is_she_married_Who_Is_Her_Spouse>Marta Milans, is she married? Who Is Her Spouse?</span></h2><p>Milans has not yet tied the knot and has no husband. However, after witnessing her portraying a wife on film, we may speculate about what a wonderful wife she would make.

At the age of three, Marta had even started to play the violin.</p><p>Marta is a dual citizen of the United States and Spain. Her ethnicity is Caucasian.</p><h2><span id=grew_up_with_her_brother_and_twin_sister>grew up with her brother and twin sister</span></h2><p>Gadea Pérez-Andújar, Marta Milans’ twin sister, and Sander, her younger brother, are her siblings.
