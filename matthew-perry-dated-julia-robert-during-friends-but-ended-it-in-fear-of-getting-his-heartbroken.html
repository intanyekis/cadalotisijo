According to Perry, he worried about getting his heart broken by the star actress. "Two months later, I was single," Perry wrote in his memoir. "Dating Julia Roberts had been too much for me. I had been constantly certain that she was going to break up with me. Why would she not? I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unloveable."</p><p>A tough ending to their relationship.

At that point, Perry realized that he was struggling with alcohol issues. "Love of alcohol had indeed become the helmsman of my life, but I don't think I realized just how much it controlled me until one night when I was out with my girlfriend at the time, Gaby."</p><p>He continues, "Gaby didn't have any alcohol at home, which is, of course, totally fine, but for me at the age of twenty-one, all of a sudden this creeping feeling came over me for the first time. I felt my blood on fire for more to drink."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are well aware that Perry spent millions on overcoming his struggles, with several rehab stints.

Perry recalled the specific moment he knew things were getting a little too real in terms of his crush.</p><p>"I was immediately taken by her (how could I not be?) and liked her, and I got the sense she was intrigued, too – maybe it was going to be something."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Back then I got two jobs in one day – one was Haywire, an America's Funniest Home Videos-type show, and the other was a sitcom. So I called Jennifer and I said, 'You're the first person I wanted to tell this to!' Looking back, it was clear that this made her think I liked her too much or in the wrong kind of way… and I only compounded the error by then asking her out."</p><p>Perry got rejected by Aniston, however, he does credit <a href=#>his Friends co-star for helping him out during his darkest time</a>.</p><p>“I had long since gotten over her – ever since she started dating Brad Pitt, I was fine – and had worked out exactly how long to look at her without it being awkward, but still, to be confronted by Jennifer Aniston was devastating. And I was confused."</p><p>He continues “‘How can you tell?’ I said. I never worked drunk. ‘I’ve been trying to hide it." Despite the awkwardness after the date rejection, Aniston played a major role in helping Perry out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXZmutbHDZqGupJmWerO7wZ6prWWUqr%2BqusZmnauhlaOxtHnBrqtmnZ6ZsqV5yK1koqZdm7KivoyonWaflanBqrrGZp%2Biq12dsqK%2B05upqKOVo3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicole-mcmackin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicole McMackin">&larr;
