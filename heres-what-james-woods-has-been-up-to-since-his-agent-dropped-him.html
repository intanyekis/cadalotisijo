At the time, the public was blissfully unaware of his right-wing conspiracist leanings, which was largely due to his lack of a platform in the pre-social media age. But so-called <a href=#>"cancel culture"</a> led to Woods being dropped by his agent in 2018, after it transpired that the actor had been posting thoroughly offensive, alt-right untruths on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>James Woods' Most Profitable Roles, Ranked</a></span></p><p>One of the few Republicans in Hollywood, James Woods pretty much hasn't acted since his agent dropped him. So what exactly has he been doing all this time? Here's what James Woods has been up to since his agent dropped him.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-been-trying-to-get-trump-re-elected><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He's Been Trying To Get Trump Re-Elected</span></h2><p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, James Woods is a Trump supporter. This makes him among a tiny minority of celebs who have <a href=#>openly endorsed Trump</a>. Accordingly, he was busy in 2020 attempting to get Trump re-elected, attempts which were, of course, all in vain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=those-pepe-le-pew-tweets><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Those Pepe Le Pew Tweets...</span></h2><p>When it was revealed that cartoon skunk Pepe Le Pew would not be making a comeback in <a href=#>Space Jam 2 </a>due to the character's overt propagation of rape culture, James Woods lost it. "#RIPPepeLePew" the actor Tweeted above a black and white image of the cartoon character with the memorial 1945-2021 enscribed on the image. Users were flabbergasted by the bizarre Tweet, with one person replying, "I have no words."</p><h2 id=he-39-s-been-calling-for-joe-biden-39-s-resignation><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He's Been Calling For Joe Biden's Resignation</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the Talbian seized control of Afghanistan, James Woods immediately blamed President Biden. "As Americans are slaughtered by terrorist savagesâ€¦ #BidenMustResign" Tweeted Woods, who also retweeted a viral post that wrongly claimed dogs left in Kabul airport belonged to the U.S. military.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-sparked-engagement-rumors-with-his-young-girlfriend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He's Sparked Engagement Rumors With His Young Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Does it come as much of a surprise that James Woods has a very young girlfriend? As of writing, Woods is 74-years-old, while <a href=#>his girlfriend, Sara Miller,</a> is a mere 32-years-old. To be fair, that huge age gap looks decent in comparison to the actor's previous relationship with 20-year-old girlfriend, Kristen Bauguess.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>James Woods And Other Right-Wing Celebrities Trending On Twitter Has Users Believing It's A Concerning 'National Holiday'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were rumors that Woods and Miller were engaged after they were seen sporting huge diamond rings.</p><h2 id=sean-young-accused-him-of-destroying-her-career><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sean Young Accused Him Of Destroying Her Career</span></h2><p><a href=#>Sean Young was blacklisted by Hollywood</a> for daring to speak up about sexual harassment decades before MeToo even existed. Hollywood may have ended her career, but Young continues to speak out on what she terms "toxic Hollywood men." The Blade Runner star called out Woods in particular, accusing him of destroying her prospects of a long and illustrious Hollywood career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He actually was successful in destroying my studio career," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Young explained</a>, adding, "I remember, I got hired by an agent and he grilled me for an hour about James Woods, and I was like, 'Oh, (expletive).' So I have to walk in every time now and explain why I'm not crazy? I don't see this guy having to explain anything, so what the (expletive) is your problem?"</p><h2 id=spreading-conspiracy-theories-online-is-his-current-forte><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Spreading Conspiracy Theories Online Is His Current Forte</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, James Woods has gone from acclaimed Oscar-nominated actor to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">QAnon conspiracy theorist</a>. QAnon advocates believe in a wholly unfounded and absurd theory that Democrats run a Satanic child abuse ring headed by Tom Hanks, with Donald Trump as the savior who is attempting to expose said abuers. It should be noted that Trump himself <a href=#>has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women</a>, so this theory makes little sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Why James Woods Was Cancelled By Hollywood</a></span></p><p>James Woods Tweeted, "Iâ€™m holding back my thoughts on #Q. Letâ€™s see where the wind blows" before raging against Democrats supposedly protecting predators, a notion propagated by exponents of QAnon.</p><h2 id=he-39-s-been-raging-against-pronouns><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He's Been Raging Against Pronouns</span></h2><p>As with many members of the alt-right, James Woods somehow views using suitable pronouns as a threat. Going on a transphobic Twitter rant, Woods raged against using "they" as a singular pronoun. But he got owned by the Dictionary (yes, the actual Dictionary), who replied, "They has been in use as a singular pronoun since the 1300s. Among its best known users in history: Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Jane Austen."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-house-got-destroyed-by-storm-henri><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His House Got Destroyed By Storm Henri</span></h2><p>In August 2021, Storm Henri wreaked havoc across New England. James Woods' Rhode Island home was severely damaged by the storm, as trees fell on the fancy property. The actor Tweeted a photo of trees destroying his house, which reportedly cost several million dollars.</p><h2 id=this-movie-scene-of-woods-as-giuliani-went-viral><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>This Movie Scene Of Woods As Giuliani Went Viral</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>James Woods went viral for all the wrong reasons in November 2020 when a clip of him playing Rudy Giuliani in the 2003 TV movie, Rudy: The Rudy Giuliani resurfaced. The clip in question showed the former New York mayor going for a romantic moonlit stroll with his wife. Twitter users couldn't contain their zeal at the cringeworthy scene, with one user writing, "This romantic moonlit scene in RUDY: THE RUDY GIULIANI STORY absolutely murdered me.
