These teams have also added a definite fun factor to their division.</p><p>As one of the international wrestling scene’s most popular factions, Los Ingobernables de Japon are dominating New Japan’s tag team division with EVIL and Sanada as the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. Their partnership was born from the close knit friendship that binds LIJ.&nbsp; Some of NJPW’s best teams have begun this way while others have born out of classic rivalries.&nbsp; However they get their starts, tag team wrestling will always be an important part of what New Japan does especially the value the promotion places on one on one competition.&nbsp; They can be brought together any number of ways, but the common thread as they are all born from powers combined.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9uanFpY2K7psOMo5ipmZ5ivbO7jLCcnaaVqLGixYyopWasmKq%2FtLDAsmRrZWdiu6bDjJucoKGeo7avs4ycpqesmaPCpr%2BMsqauppdiuaq7zWajnpmmmsBur86mp5qmqWK6sL7EaGo%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./15-disney-stars-who-actually-managed-to-keep-it-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Disney Stars Who Actually Managed To Keep It Together">&larr;
