With the incomes that professional athletes bring in these days, it's hard to think they could find a wife or girlfriend who makes more than them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of these athletes have made a big name for themselves, even being seen as role models and MVPs, whereas others have not quite caught up t the fame or success like their teammates. Either way, it's hard to imagine a wife or a girlfriend of a professional athlete having a bigger income, especially when their athlete boy-toy is very well known. But these ladies give them a run for the money. As for the others, they're more likely to count their blessings for having such a valuable partner to keep them from going hungry after retirement.</p><p>As some of these entries&nbsp;may not be all that surprising, some, on the other hand, may really catch your eye. Get ready for a few surprises because here are&nbsp;15 WAGs&nbsp;who made more than their boyfriends and husbands. Girl power!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=erin-andrews>Erin Andrews</h2><p><a href=#>Erin Andrews</a> is a role model for all women. The journalist fought her way uphill in the male-dominated industry of sports journalism and is now one of the most recognized commentators and sideline reporters in the industry. The world of sports journalism has&nbsp;made this brainy babe worth more than $40 million.</p><p>Hockey player Jarret Stoll is her fiancé who played for the NHL for nearly 14 years. The center got a good amount of playing time back in the day, so it's not hard to imagine he was making a pretty good living, but the former NHL star fell&nbsp;a couple million shy of his wife with a net worth of $16 million.</p><h2 id=hilary-duff>Hilary Duff</h2><p>As long as we are on the subject of former NHL players who made less money than their partner, let's talk about <a href=#>Hilary Duff</a> and <a href=#>Mike Comrie</a>. This may come as a shock to you because Duff was a former teen idol who made her debut on Disney Channel and has a net worth estimated to be over&nbsp;$25 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former hockey player Mike Comrie is worth around $10 million, making Duff worth more than twice what her ex-husband is worth, and her net worth is likely to increase as a celebrity (especially with the success of her show Younger), as his will most likely decrease because he is already retired. This is what dreams are made of!</p><h2 id=elisabeth-hasselbeck>Elisabeth Hasselbeck</h2><p><a href=#>Tim Hasselbeck</a> was basically just a backup quarterback when he was playing in the NFL. The former player had a seven year run with the National Football League, playing for six different teams, and only starting for one of them. He caught&nbsp;his big break to be a starting quarterback for The Washington Redskins, but he didn't do too well and Hasselbeck had himself throwing more interceptions than making touchdowns. Yikes.</p><p>While Hasselbeck had been struggling to accomplish anything below average on the field, his wife was doing just fine as a television personality and talk show host. <a href=#>Elisabeth</a> is the breadwinner of this family, with a net worth of $16 million, while her hubby is only worth $12 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-jameson>Jenna Jameson</h2><p>The relationship that started between the mixed martial arts legend <a href=#>Tito Ortiz</a> and <a href=#>Jenna Jameson</a> was conducted on none other than MySpace. That's right, the relationship between the two started on the social networking site&nbsp;while Jenna was still married to adult film actor Jay Grdina. The former adult film legend&nbsp;went on to divorce him and ended up having twin baby boys with Ortiz. The two didn't last very long, but it was still a relationship where the girlfriend of an athlete had a higher cash flow than her partner. Nowadays, Jenna's net worth is rumoured to be upwards of $30 million, compared to Ortiz's $15 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian>Khloe Kardashian</h2><p><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a> and <a href=#>Lamar Odom</a> may have called it quits a while ago, but it's no surprise that this Kardashian still has her empire. Everyone is aware of the empire that the Kardashian name has amassed&nbsp;and the constant cash flow&nbsp;it brings in, making Khloe one of the more famous (ex) wives when it comes to sports and athletes. Khloe K and her empire have her at a current net worth of around&nbsp;$40 million dollars, and her former hubby falling in close 2nd with a $30 million net worth, falling only $10 million short of being the family breadwinner.</p><h2 id=angie-harmon>Angie Harmon</h2><p>The popular Rizzoli and Isles star, has a net worth of over $20 million. <a href=#>Harmon</a> is married to former Giants quarterback Jason Sheron. At the end of the day, the amount of cash his wife is making still outweighs what he's bringing&nbsp;home. But regardless of who may have the most cash flow, the couple are always going to be well off due to Angie's successful acting career and Sheron keeping up appearances on talk shows and things alike. So neither of them are hurting at all!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keyshia-cole>Keyshia Cole</h2><p>Not only is this woman richer, she's also a lot more famous than her husband Daniel “Boobie” Gibson. While some basketball players are known worldwide, it's sad to have to admit that not all athletes get as much stardom as their teammates. If you know basketball, then you know Daniel “Boobie” Gibson. Basketball fans either loved or hated him due to his high intensity, but there's no grey area when we admit that Gibson scored off the court when he married <a href=#>Keyshia Cole</a>, the famous singer and songwriter, with 3 albums that went platinum. Compare that to a career with the Cleveland Cavaliers only averaging double-digit points in two of them, and you'll see it's not all that hard to comprehend that Keyshia Cole, who's net worth is estimated to be almost $10 million, is making more than her husband.</p><h2 id=iggy-azalea>Iggy Azalea</h2><p>Oh, she's fancy alright. <a href=#>Iggy</a> proved just how fancy she was by being worth more than her ex boy-toy Nick Young, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, despite his many running years with the NBA.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young is a shoot guard with a net worth of about $8 million, and his ex Azalea has a net worth of about $10 million. We're all aware that the couple's breakup was inevitable, not because she had a larger net worth, but because Nick young was caught redhanded&nbsp;(you may have caught a glimpse of the viral video on the web) by D'Angelo Russel,&nbsp;admitting he was unfaithful to Iggy.</p><h2 id=kendra-wilkinson>Kendra Wilkinson</h2><p>The lucky Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver <a href=#>Hank Baskett</a>&nbsp;did what every athlete, and man in general, could only dream of. The former football player managed to steal a girl from <a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a>.</p><p>Baskett didn't score with just any playmate either, he scored with none other than THE <a href=#>Kendra Wilkinson</a>. The two met sometime in early 2009, and one thing led to another, and next thing you know Kendra was moving out of the mansion and planning a wedding. Which of course, turned into a reality tv show. Nevertheless, the two eloped and are still married to this day. Although it's easy to say that Hank Baskett already won the lottery with Kendra, he doubled his winnings when we learned that Kendra was making nearly twice as much as Baskett with a $6 million net worth, and Baskett's coming in at $3.5 million. Score!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jamie-lynn-sigler>Jamie-Lynn Sigler</h2><p><a href=#>Jamie-Lynn Sigler</a> married minor-league baseball player Cutter Dykstra, who's only real achievements was marrying Jamie and his legend of a father, <a href=#>Lenny Dykstra</a>, who played for the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies as a center fielder. Now, when it comes to supporting the family, Sigler really takes home the gold. The difference between these two and their net worth is remarkable: Dykstra barely&nbsp;makes it to first base with a net worth of $1.5 million and Sigler hits&nbsp;a home run with a net worth of $25 million. Being in a hit HBO show like The Sopranos can really boost your income!</p><h2 id=adriana-lima>Adriana Lima</h2><p>Marko Jaric was the lucky man to marry this sexy supermodel. But he's not exactly a celebrated figure of good basketball. Jaric struggled through most of his career in the NBA, even making it hard for him to maintain starter status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no surprise that Jaric made less money when it came to his marriage to <a href=#>Adriana Lima</a>, the real surprise was that this world&nbsp;famous supermodel married him at all. The two called it quits after five years, but Lima's net worth was doing&nbsp;circles around Jaric's $20 million, with a salary of $11 million per year and a net worth of $75 million.</p><h2 id=shakira>Shakira</h2><p>With a net worth around $40 million and still having a few good years ahead of him in his&nbsp;soccer career, <a href=#>Gerard Pique</a> still has time to increase his numbers. The world famous soccer player has won basically every single title there is to win, which begs the question, how can his wife be making more than him?</p><p>Well, that's easy. His wife is one of the most famous singers of all time, <a href=#>Shakira</a>. In fact, most men who are playing professional soccer like Pique aren't anywhere near the net worth of his wife, who&nbsp;is worth more than $300 million. Pique&nbsp;shouldn't feel too bad, even Messi is ranking lower on the net worth scale compared to his wife, and he's worth around $280 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carrie-underwood>Carrie Underwood</h2><p>We've seen a lot of former athletes on this list, but <a href=#>Mike Fisher</a> is far from it. Being a well established player for the NHL with one of the highest net worths for a hockey player, his worth is estimated to be around $30 million.</p><p>Surely, Fisher wouldn't have had much competition when it came to net worth with his partner, if he hadn't married such a beautiful and successful woman. Fisher married the 2005 winner of American Idol, <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>. She has won six Grammy awards and 16 Billboard music awards among other prizes, and her net worth is about $85 million to top it all off. Fisher sure scored with this all-American girl.</p><h2 id=jessica-simpson>Jessica Simpson</h2><p>From actress to singer to talk show host, <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> has done it all. Simpson has released seven Billboard top 40 hits, two platinum albums, and three certified gold albums. This women is beautiful and successful - she's a loaded gun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica Simpson married the former San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints tight end Eric Johnson. Johnson played for 7 seven years in the NFL and scored 9 touchdowns in his entire career, so it's safe to say his wife has had a little more success. Simpson is&nbsp;worth an astounding $150 million and her hubby is worth... $100,000... yikes!</p><h2 id=gisele-bundchen>Gisele Bundchen</h2><p><a href=#>Tom Brady</a>, the 5x Super Bowl winner and 4x MVP. Now, how many people can say they've accomplished that much? He has proved time and time again just how talented he is on the field, and continued to prove&nbsp;so by also being one of the highest paid athletes in the world. His salary is around $26.5 million, and Brady’s net worth is more than $180 million. It's no secret that Tom Brady is one very successful man, but perhaps his biggest win was his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I couldn't even imagine the kind of gold diggers that were after Brady, his fame, and especially his money. But lucky for him, Brady married a woman who did not need his money at all. He scored big time when he married <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen</a>, one of the most well known supermodels in the world. Her salary has her bringing in around $40 million a year, and her net worth is nothing less than $360 million.</p><p>I think it's safe to say that Brady's biggest win would be the one he scored off the field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toaWVixKKz0mauoaddoq6lsYympqudXam1orqMrZ%2BeoaJirrW0y56rnmWSpManvsiepZ2rXZa7pXnHrqqbmZ6ZwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-ivory-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Ivory Net Worth  How Much Is Chris Ivory Worth?">&larr;
