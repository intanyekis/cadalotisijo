But what makes the Kardashian family even more bizarre is the small dating pool some of them seem to share. Little do fans know that with the subtle addition of Devin Booker to the family, he too shares a romantic history with one of the Kardashian's old friends, who also happens to be Tristan Thompson's ex-girlfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which ex-girlfriend did Tristan Thompson and Devin Booker have in common? What does Kendall Jenner think of Devin Booker's ex-girlfriend? Is Devin Booker on good terms with Tristan Thompson? Keep reading to find out the truth...</p><h2 id=devin-booker-dated-jordyn-woods>Devin Booker Dated Jordyn Woods</h2><p>Devin Booker used to date Jordyn Woods who happens to be <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>'s long-time best friend and co-reality tv star in the Life of Kylie. A short period before dating Kendall Jenner, there were photographs of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA player with Jordyn going on a date</a> together in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> even reported that Kendall Jenner and Beau Ben Simmons went on a double date with Devin Booker and Jordyn Woods. That's why when fans found out that Kendall and Devin started dating on July 2020, they had mixed feelings about the complicated circle of romantic relationships within the Kardashian-Jenner clan.</p><h2 id=fans-believe-jordyn-woods-threw-shade-at-kendall-jenner>Fans Believe Jordyn Woods Threw Shade At Kendall Jenner</h2><p>Shortly after fans began speculating about Kendall and Devin's possible relationship in 2020, Jordyn Woods told Twitter what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans believe was her reaction to the rumors</a>. In a tweet saying "haha, good morning" followed by trash can emojis, fans think she was subtly throwing shade at Devin's now two-year girlfriend, Kendall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jordyn's tweet didn't sit right with most of the Kardashians fans, especially when the issue of her entanglement with Tristan Thompson was still hot on social media. Adding more fuel to the bashing, Jordyn didn't have her best friend Kylie Jenner's back as she chose to side with her sister, <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'KUWTK': Khloe Kardashian Gets Dragged For Expecting An Apology From Jordyn Woods</a></span></p><p>Defending Kendall's side, they say that the fashion model's decision to date Devin was reasonable as he was already single then.

He had a history of cheating on Khloe Kardashian, even when Khloe was only pregnant with their first child, True. And until they have decided to welcome a second child through surrogacy, Tristan is again caught cheating with another girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Returning to Tristan and Jordyn's relationship, fans saw the two publicly displaying their affection in a club even when it was clear that Jordyn, Khloe, and Tristan were expecting a baby together. Later in 2019, Jordyn finally admitted to kissing Tristan Thompson through her interview with Jada Pinkett-Smith and Adrienne Banfield-Norris' Red Table Talk show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Model Jordyn Woods 'Doesn’t Think About The Pain' Caused By Her Kardashian Controversy Last Year</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After hearing her side, many fans understood both sides of the story; Khloe's and Jordyn's. Despite the Kardashian-Jenner clan canceling Jordyn Woods from their family, Jordyn still fought the hate by saying, "I [Jordyn Woods] truly believe the only person who can cancel you is God, and God isn't going to cancel you."</p><h2 id=did-devin-booker-punch-tristan-thompson>Did Devin Booker Punch Tristan Thompson?</h2><p>Following the recent rough patch that Devin Booker and girlfriend Kendall Jenner have been in, a Reddit fan started speculating that Devin and Tristan could have beef between them because Tristan might be luring Kendall. The rumors escalated further when more fans chipped in, thinking that Devin might have punched Tristan Thompson during Kylie Jenner's friend Stassie's birthday party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the fan who made the original Reddit confirmed that the rumor they spread was utterly false, and Devin did not punch Tristan Thompson. They later apologized, saying, "I apologize to Devin Booker. Promoting rumors that accuse you of violence was not fair. When I originally did the post, I only had the prank in mind. Not you and your career and relationships."</p><h2 id=why-did-kylie-jenner-stop-being-friends-with-jordyn-woods>Why Did Kylie Jenner Stop Being Friends With Jordyn Woods?</h2><p>As of July 2022, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner still keeps her distance from her 'best friend'</a> by not following Jordyn and Jordyn's mother on Instagram.
