While It’s known <a href=#>what the slain cast members have been up to since their departure from the show</a>, let’s take a look at what the stars that survived the finale have been up to since, shall we? Strap on your armor, sheath your broadsword and hop aboard a fire-breathing dragon; it's time to do this thing.</p><h2 id=kristofer-hivju><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kristofer Hivju</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kristofer Hivju portrayed wilding leader, Brienne of Tarth-obsessed, Tormund Giantsbane on GoT. The character was not only a fan-favorite, but played for some of the greatest laughs whenever on screen. After the end of the series, Hivju would go on to voice the character of Jormungandr on the animated Disney series Duck Tales, and most recently debuted on The Witcher as Nivellen. The Norwgian actor is also set to be featured in the upcoming 2023 film Cocaine Bear and the science fiction comedy Distant.</p><h2 id=jacob-anderson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jacob Anderson</span></h2><p>Jacob Anderson has kept busy after portraying the loyal Grey Worm on GoT. Anderson has been featured in both big screen and small screen projects, such as appearing on SNL and starring as Vinder on Doctor Who. Most recently, has taken up the role of Louis in the AMC series Interview With A Vampire. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Unfortunately, many fans are pitting Anderson’s Louis against Brad Pitt's interpretation.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Game Of Thrones Made Emily Carey 'Nervous' About Doing These House Of The Dragon Scenes</a></span></p><h2 id=gwendoline-christie><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Gwendoline Christie</span></h2><p>Brienne of Tarth herself, Gwendoline Christie, decided to make a move back to the theatrical stage after GoT. Christie portrayed Titania/Hippolyta in A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 2019. On the big screen, the Star Wars: The Force Awakens actress was featured in the comedy drama The Personal History of David Copperfield, and most recently the black comedy Flux Gourmet. Christie is also set to be featured in the upcoming series Wednesday, portraying Larissa Weems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-bradley><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>John Bradley</span></h2><p>The lovable sidekick to Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly was played by John Bradley to much fan appreciation. Following his years on GoT, Bradley was featured in the 2022 disaster film Moonfall, Marry Me, a 2022 romantic comedy, and family drama The Railway Children Return. On the small screen, Bradley was featured on SNL,Robot Chicken, and will be featured in the upcoming series The Three-Body Problem.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Rejected Game Of Thrones Spinoff That Turned Into House Of The Dragon</a></span></p><h2 id=jerome-flynn><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jerome Flynn</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the show’s fan-favorites, Jerome Flynn, played the part of the Bronn on the show. After the finale, Flynn showed up in films such as John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. Flynn is also set to be featured in the upcoming Western miniseries 1923. Flynn’s career was quite extensive before he starred in GoT, and It seems like the Tommy Zoom actor is continuing that trend.</p><h2 id=isaac-hempstead-wright><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Isaac Hempstead Wright</span></h2><p>Who would have ever guessed that Bran would end up King of the North? Well, he did, and the less said about that the better. Anyhow, the actor that portrayed Bran, Isaac Hempstead Wright, hasn’t been extremely busy after the conclusion of GoT as far as acting roles goes. Wright’s only feature film was after Thrones was 2021’s Voyagers. It appears that the former King of the North is taking a break from acting for the moment. However, Wright did go back to school to study neuroscience at University College London.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maisie-williams><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Maisie Williams</span></h2><p>There’s something about being a member of the GoT cast and starring in a Marvel property. Such is the case with Maisie Williams as the former Arya Stark was cast in The New Mutants, which was meant for a theatrical debut but instead landed on Disney+ after Disney purchased Fox. Williams was also featured in the 2020 horror film The Owners. As for upcoming projects, Williams is set to be featured in a slew of projects such as the stop-motion animated short Salvation Has No Name, Sinner V. Saints.

Post-GoT, Turner has been featured in such films and TV shows as Do Revenge with Maya Hawke and the HBO Max true crime miniseries The Staircase, as well as the TV thriller Survive in 2019.</p><h2 id=kit-harrington><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kit Harrington</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kit Harrington found himself becoming a member of the much-ballyhooed mega franchise the MCU after finishing GoT. The former Jon Snow (he knows nothing, by the way) has traded in his broadsword for the Ebony Blade to play Dane Whitman aka Black Knight. Arlington made his debut as the character in The Eternals in 2021 and is set to return based on The Eternals post-credit scene. Hamilton also hosted SNL back in 2019 and starred in the sequel to How to Train Your Dragon, reprising his role as Eret.</p><h2 id=peter-dinklage><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Peter Dinklage</span></h2><p>Peter Dinklage was arguably the biggest star to emerge from the series. Portraying Tyrion Lannister, the hedonistic, family shame, quickly became one of the most popular characters of the show. After GoT finished up, Dinklage went on to be featured in such films as Avengers: Infinity War as Eitri The King of the Dwarves. Dinklage would also star as Cyrano in the off-Broadway play and in the 2021 film Cyrano de Bergerac.The X-Men: Days of Future’s Past star has recently had fans <a href=#>reject his criticism of Disney’s Snow White remake</a>. Hopefully, the actor won't continue down the controversy road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOhnGabkajBbrvFZp6apZVivKd506GpqKaVqHqlu8innmasn5muunnCmqqtZZ2auqOx0axkraCRqXq0wdGvoK%2BdlGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./logan-miller.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Logan Miller Dating, Girlfriend, Affair, Relationship, Net Worth">&larr;
